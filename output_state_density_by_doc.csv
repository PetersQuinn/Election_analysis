post_01_guardian_trump_underestimated.txt,post,Guardian,2024-11-27,"n the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, Guardian polling averages showed Kamala Harris winning an incredibly close race. Still, Donald Trump won, showing that yet again his volume of support was underestimated.

Though Guardian US averages had Harris winning, the final result was within the margin of errors for high-quality polls conducted this election cycle.

With an estimated 99% of the vote counted, Guardian US national polling averages were off by three percentage points as of 20 November 2024, an analysis of the 2024 presidential election returns has found.

Though this may change as more votes are counted, preliminary results show that polls underestimated the level of support for Trump for the third election in a row. The Guardian US national polling average had Harris at 48% and Trump at 47%, with the final results being Trump 50%, Harris 48%, an error similar to the polling errors in past elections.

Guardian US national averages only took the average of high-quality polls, but swing state polling averages used every poll gathered by 538. There are fewer swing state polls conducted, but are important because national polling is not indicative of who is going to win the election, only the level of support nationally.

Guardian US averages had Trump winning four out of seven key swing states and there was a bigger spread in the accuracy for swing states.

“You don’t have a lot of high-quality polls in swing states in particular,” Andy Crosby, assistant professor of teaching at the University of California Riverside School of Public Policy, said.

Swing state polling averages were not off by a significant amount, and nationally, swing state polls were accurate, Crosby said.

“High-quality polls were in the margin of error for a lot of these critical swing states,” Crosby said.

In the key swing states the Guardian US followed, the difference between the polls and the results ranged from a 0 percentage point difference in Georgia to a 4 percentage point difference in Arizona.

The Guardian US began tracking national and swing state polling in August and in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, the rolling 10-day averages showed an extremely tight race.

Throughout October 2024, Harris polled one to two points above Trump, with the gap falling to a single percentage point on 31 October, the last day that Guardian US took an average of state and national polls.

The election result shows that the 2024 presidential election polling error is similar to past elections. A 538 analysis of past polling errors found that between 1996 and 2020, the polling errors for their averages ranged from .1 pp in 2008 to 4.3pp in 1996. The Guardian’s national polling error was 3 percentage points, which means the polling in 2024 was not a deviation from years past.

Though the polling averages were close to the final results, the averages all biased the Democrats, with Trump doing better in every swing state than the polling averages expected.

This is a recurring pattern in elections where Donald Trump ran for office. Polls underestimated Trump’s performance in 2016, when he defeated Hillary Clinton, and in 2020, even though he lost to Joe Biden.

Though polling in 2016 has been attacked for missing Trump support, national polling was accurate according to the American Association for Public Opinion Research.

“After the 2016 election, there was a big effort to kind of do a debrief on what,” Crosby said of the AAPOR report. “There was a lot of inward thinking, like, what are we going to do to address this? Largely again the conclusion was, look, the national polls were accurate.”

It was, again, issues in swing state polling that missed the mark.

“We see this kind of pattern repeating itself in the sense of, oh gosh, it’s going to come down to the swing states and we don’t have the data for the swing states,” Crosby said.

The polls in 2020 had the highest polling error in 40 years for the popular vote, even though Biden won in line with what the polls expected, according to the 2020 AAPOR report. Why the polls were off remains a mystery though.

“Identifying conclusively why polls overstated the Democratic-Republican margin relative to the certified vote appears to be impossible with the available data,” the report said.

There are several reasons the polls might have had errors in the same direction across three elections, according to experts like Crosby and polling pontificators like Nate Silver.

Random chance, the demographics of who responds to polls, the elections being extremely close, or even people reluctant to voice support for Trump to strangers on the phone could all make up part of the overall explanation. But Trump won’t be running in 2028, so it remains to be seen if there is some unique aspect of Trump voters that continues to elude pollsters ability to measure his support.

post_02_northwestern_2024_election.txt,post,Northwestern,2024-11-20,"During a Nov. 11 post-election panel, four IPR experts unpacked the 2024 election results, putting polls, partisanship, and policy reactions into context for the more than 160 in attendance.

“The past few weeks and months have brought intense debate about the state and the direction of our country and our democracy,” IPR Director Andrew V. Papachristos said. “It's in moments like these that it's essential to come together in spaces like this and to work together to better understand these extremely complex issues.”

IPR political scientist Laurel Harbridge-Yong began by framing the election and the Republican sweep of Congress and the presidency, putting Donald Trump back in the White House for a second term.

“Coming into this election, it seemed like things might be close,” Harbridge-Yong explained, as polls showed a tight presidential race between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

But the results didn’t end up being that close. All seven swing states went to Trump—who won 312 electoral votes to Harris’ 226—as well as the popular vote.

“In many respects, this was a normal, anti-incumbent election that just so happened to benefit an abnormal candidate,” she said, with poor perceptions of the economy and Biden’s low approval ratings helping the opposing party.

Harbridge-Yong then invited three IPR faculty panelists—political scientist Chloe Thurston, IPR social psychologist Eli Finkel, and communications and policy scholar Erik Nisbet—to reflect on what their research reveals about this political moment.

How did the Biden administration’s policies influence the 2024 election’s outcome? Thurston argued the post-election narrative about whether the economy mattered more than concerns about democracy is incomplete.  

“I think that there is a mistaken, in my opinion, view that robust economic policymaking that targeted specific areas and needs would restore faith in American democracy,” Thurston said.

During his time in office, President Joe Biden presented himself as occupying a role similar to President Franklin Roosevelt in a moment of economic and political crisis, she said. Biden’s administration had several successes with legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, which led some, including Biden’s staff, to believe that voters would reward the administration for these policies at the ballot box.

“Policies can shift the political views of the mass public,” Thurston said. “They affect what people think the government can do, is capable of doing, but also what they value and what they don't necessarily want to lose.”

But she sees a limit to how much policy can change voters’ attitudes toward politicians. Her research on policy feedback with IPR political scientist Daniel Galvin, shows that a person’s political identity is often what shapes their views about a given policy, not the other way around.

“This is one reason why Obamacare was not very popular among conservatives when it was first created, but many years later, people do appreciate some of the things that the Affordable Care Act provided them with,” she said. 

And just because people benefit from policies passed by the opposing party, doesn’t mean that they will stop supporting their party. Ultimately, “Bidenomics” didn’t gain enough support to build a partisan majority and win Harris the presidency, Thurston explained.

“It's hard to design policy to produce its intended policy consequences,” she said. “It's harder still to design policy to produce our intended political consequences.”

To understand what happened in 2024, Finkel argued, you need to understand what’s been going on in presidential elections across the last decades. He explained that the margins in the popular vote in presidential elections have grown closer since the early 20th century, which means that immense power rests on a knife's edge every election.

As elections shift power in Congress and the presidency every few years “you see the parties really focus in on the differences,” he said. 

To gain political power over their opponents, both parties use moral outrage to bring voters to the polls. While narrower election margins have made it more urgent to get votes, politics have calcified, or grown more rigid, meaning there’s less of a chance of big swings in either party’s favor. The narratives we share about elections also matter, Finkel says.

“The stories that we—when I say we, I mean active partisans—tell about what's happening in these elections gets more and more serious,” he said. He shared examples of both conservatives and liberals talking about their political opponents in existential terms, like a poll conducted in October 2020 where 70% of respondents agreed that “if the wrong candidate wins this election, America will not recover.”  

 As partisan division reaches new levels, Finkel argued that “our politics have become a holy war.” He cited research he co-led with former IPR political scientist James Druckman, now at the University of Rochester, showing that political sectarianism, or bitter partisanship where party members have more contempt for the other party than affection for their own, has increased.

“What I would like to propose to all of us, is to consider what the greater threat is to our society: Is it insufficient moral clarity, that is, we haven't really stood up with fervor for the things we believe in?” Finkel asked. “Or is it too much moral fervor—we are so sure of the rightness of what we're doing that we will absolutely do what is required to make sure that our side wins?”

In the 2022 midterm elections, extreme candidates lost in heavily Republican areas in most cases, Nisbet said, which seemed to show the success of the Democrats’ message that democracy was at stake. Still, nearly 200 Republican candidates who denied the 2020 election results won their midterm races. 

“What is undemocratic behavior by a candidate or party is easily rationalized based upon our polarized partisan views or sectarian views,” he explained.

But would a “democracy on the ballot” strategy or a strategy to unite against an illiberal candidate work in 2024? Nisbet asked. He cited a CNN poll showing that more voters in 2024 thought democracy was under threat than in 2022. So why did Trump win?

Nisbet argued that the way people define democracy matters. Through the Comparative National Elections Project, he conducted a survey on the issues Americans believe are important for democracy after the 2022 midterm election. 

“What we see here is when we ask people how you define democracy, Trump did best or moved the needle among those voters who believe that democracy should be defined, at least to some degree, as ‘jobs for everyone,’” he said.

This broader, distributive understanding of democracy which includes  economic wellbeing, benefited Trump who had a strong economy during his first term. In contrast, demographic groups that tended to understand democracy more in terms of free and fair elections or civil liberties like freedom of expression moved away from Trump in 2024 compared to 2020. 

“My argument is that the Dems’ democracy strategy failed because they took the wrong lessons from the midterms,” Nisbet said. “Who threatens democracy and what is democratic is subjective and depends on very polarized views.”

Harris ultimately lost because she failed to communicate a vision of democracy that was “more inclusive for these other voters who were not very ideological, but look at democracy through a broader lens,” he said.",1200,0,0,0,0
post_03_abc_polls_underestimate.txt,post,abcNEWS,2024-11-08,"Here at 538, we think a big part of our jobs during election season is to explore and explain how much trust you should put in all the people telling you who's going to win. More than anyone else, given the amount of data they produce and the press and public's voracious appetite for it, that includes the pollsters. That's why we do things like publish ratings of pollster accuracy and transparency and make complex election forecasting models to explore what would happen if the polls are off by as much as they have been historically.

Polls are also important for the reporting we do here at 538, which is rooted in empiricism and data. Furthermore, the quality of the data we're getting about public opinion is important not just for predicting election outcomes and doing political journalism, but also for many other parts of our democratic process.

Suffice it to say, if polls are getting more or less accurate, the public needs to know. And now that the 2024 election is in the rearview mirror, we can take a rough first look at how accurate polling was.

Just one note on scope before we get started: In this article, I will be taking just a broad look at how polls did in states where the results are final or nearly final. That means we won't assess the accuracy of national polls yet, given how many votes are still left to count in California and other slow-counting states, and won't be assessing the accuracy of individual pollsters, which we'll do when we update our pollster ratings next spring.

Despite the early narrative swirling around in the media, 2024 was a pretty good year to be a pollster. According to 538's analysis of polls conducted in competitive states* in which over 95 percent of the expected vote was counted as of Nov. 8 at 6 a.m. Eastern, the average poll conducted over the last three weeks of the campaign missed the margin of the election by just 2.94 percentage points. In the seven main swing states (minus Arizona, which is not yet at 95 percent reporting), pollsters did even better: They missed the margin by just 2.2 points.

This measure, which we call ""statistical error,"" measures how far off the polls were in each state without regard for whether they systematically overestimated support for one candidate. And by this metric, state-level polling error in 2024 is actually the lowest it has been in at least 25 years. By comparison, state-level polls in 2016 and 2020 had an average error close to 4.7 percentage points. Even in 2012, which stands out as a good year for both polling and election forecasting, the polls missed election outcomes by 3.2 percentage points.

At this early juncture, we can only speculate as to why error was so low this year. One reason could be that pollsters have mostly moved away from conducting polls using random-digit dialing — a type of polling that has recently tended to generate results that oscillate more wildly from poll to poll than other methods. One notable pollster that does still use RDD is Selzer & Co., which had Vice President Kamala Harris leading President-elect Donald Trump by 3 points in its final poll of Iowa this year. Trump ended up winning the state by about 13 points, making for a 16-point error. It looks possible that Selzer's poll had too many Democrats and college-educated voters in it, factors the firm generally does not attempt to correct for due to Selzer's philosophy of ""keeping [her] dirty hands off the data"" (to be fair, this approach had worked excellently until this year; Selzer is one of the top-rated pollsters in 538's pollster ratings).

Quinnipiac University, which also uses RDD, also generated polls that didn't seem consistent across states, though they ended up being closer to the outcome than Selzer. Meanwhile, other prominent pollsters that previously used RDD have now stopped using the method. That includes ABC News, which, after publishing an RDD poll that found now-President Joe Biden ahead of Trump by 17 points in Wisconsin in 2020 (something the pollsters behind the survey rightly identified as an outlier result when it was published), now sources its polls from Ipsos, which conducts polls online among respondents who are randomly recruited by mail and telephone.

Another factor is that pollsters are increasingly balancing their samples on both demographic and political variables, such as individuals' recalled vote in the last election. While this can cause some strange results, it generally stabilizes the polls and produces fewer outliers than one would expect by random chance alone.

Based on our preliminary findings, pollsters that used this aggressive approach to modeling had lower error than others. While this is just a loose proxy as we conduct a more thorough analysis, we found that pollsters who conducted their surveys with online probability panels, interviewed people with robo-calls, or included text messages or phone calls as part of a bigger mixed-mode sampling design tended to use more complex weighting schemes (and were especially reliant on recalled vote) — and also had lower error than pollsters using more hands-off modes:

But the news is not all good. While polls had a historically good year in terms of error, they had a medium-to-bad one in terms of statistical bias, which measures whether polls are missing the outcome in the same direction. By our math, state polls overestimated support for Harris by an average of 2.7 points on margin in competitive states.

That's lower than the statistical bias of the polls in 2016 and 2020, which underestimated Trump by 3.2 and 4.1 points, respectively. But it's higher than the bias in the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections.

This is not great news for pollsters. It means they did not fully solve their problems from 2016 and 2020 of getting enough Trump supporters to take their polls . While those problems may have been abated by pollsters weighting their data more aggressively or improving their sampling designs, they are still obviously present. You can really see this if you look at the pattern of polling bias in the competitive states from 2016 to 2024:

While pollsters managed to reduce their bias in some states, especially Wisconsin, from 2020 to 2024, the pattern in the industry is still the same: Pollsters are having a hard time reaching the types of people who support Trump.

While bias in the polling industry is troubling, it is not necessarily unexpected — especially after the last few elections. And it's worth repeating that a 3-point error on the margin is indeed very small historically. Political pollsters have designed a tool that, on average, can measure public opinion among hundreds of millions of people to within 1.5 percent of its ""true"" value (converting vote margin to vote share). When you think about it that way, it's actually remarkable that polls are as accurate as they are.

After the 2020 election, a year in which America's pollsters faced their worst performance since 1980, the American Association of Public Opinion Research (the professional society for pollsters and survey researchers) issued a warning to people trying to predict election outcomes in 2022 and 2024. ""Polls are often misinterpreted as precise predictions,"" it said. ""It is important in pre-election polling to emphasize the uncertainty by contextualizing poll results relative to their precision.... Most pre-election polls lack the precision necessary to predict the outcome of semi-close contests.""

In other words, polls are simply not up to the task of dispositively determining the result of a close race before it happens. In such a case, the margin between candidates would be too small for observers to conclude that one candidate was reliably ahead, given the inherent uncertainty in polling.

Let's put this note of caution in the context of the 2024 election. At first glance, it may seem like polls had a bad year because they pointed to a close election and Trump looks like he will cruise to a 312-226 win in the Electoral College. But as I wrote last week, because he led in the Sun Belt swing states and was tied in Pennsylvania, polls didn't really even need to underestimate Trump at all for him to win the election. And, I warned, if they underestimated him by 2 points — which would be small compared to other misses historically — he could sweep all seven swing states.

Well, it looks like that is exactly what happened. In fact, it was the modal outcome in our final forecast. AAPOR's warning is more relevant today than ever.",1434,4,4,2.789400278940028,2.789400278940028
post_04_silver_polls_underperform.txt,post,Silver Bulletin,2025-02-17,"We understand it might not seem like the most important thing at the moment. But a big part of our mission here at Silver Bulletin is evaluating public opinion — and that mostly means polls. Even over the short run, shifting public opinion in their favor is one of Democrats’ best tools for resisting President Trump — the more unpopular he becomes, the more electoral consequences Republicans will face, starting with a series of special elections beginning on April 1 and then in next year’s midterms.

But just how reliable are the polls? Well, it depends on which polls you’re talking about. We’ve updated our pollster ratings with the results of the 2024 general election, and there are some big changes, starting with the top of the list. To accompany that, we’re giving you one of our periodic report cards, a tradition that dates back to the FiveThirtyEight days. And the verdict is decidedly mixed. There’s a glass-half-full view and a glass-half-empty one.

No matter what happened, 2024 was going to be a big year for the polls. In the previous two presidential elections — where, of course, Trump was also the Republican presidential candidate — polling error was larger than average, and the polls considerably underestimated him. Polls in the 2018 and 2022 midterms did much better on both fronts, but anxiety about another high-profile polling miss still ran high among both pollsters and pundits.

In the run-up to 2024, pollsters put in a lot of work to avoid underestimating Trump for the third time in a row. And the takes came in hard and fast. Were Republicans flooding the zone with polls that were too positive for Trump? Or were the polls still too bullish on Kamala Harris?

The short answer is that the polls were biased again — but not to the same extent that they overestimated Joe Biden in 2020. Nor, with no clear favorite heading into Election Day, was the outcome anywhere near as much of a surprise as in 2016 (unless perhaps you were consuming too much “hopium”). By some measures, in fact, 2024 was a considerably above-average year. The polls weren’t that far off the mark. The problem was that nearly all of them erred in the same direction, again underestimating Trump and other Republicans. So, let’s look at the various metrics that are part of our report card.

First up, we have arguably our most important chart: polling error. By error, we mean the difference between a poll’s margin and the actual margin of the election between the top two candidates. Error is a normal and expected part of the polling process; the average error for polls in our database since 1998, which covers polls in the final three weeks before general elections for president, governor, and Congress — and presidential primaries — is 5.9 points.1

But some years are better than others, and in 2023-20242, the average polling error was lower than in any cycle in our database at only 4.5 points. The 3.4-point error in the presidential general election is the second-lowest in our database, and the 4.1-point average polling error in Senate races this cycle is the lowest in our records. In fact, polls for every type of race in 2024 — except for the presidential primaries — had lower than average error.

These are seemingly impressive numbers — polling error was about 2 points lower on average this cycle than in the previous two presidential cycles. But it’s both something of a Pyrrhic victory for pollsters because of systematic polling bias — averaging doesn’t help much when almost all the polls are off in the same direction — and because of some technical factors.

Part of what’s driving this stellar performance is the dearth of presidential primary polls. The 2024 Republican primary was short-lived and noncompetitive and the Democratic primary was basically nonexistent.3 But primary polls also tend to have the largest polling error — and it’s not particularly close4 — so their relative absence this cycle helped pull down the average error.

Also, some of the strong performance by this metric reflects pollster herding. Pollsters — J. Ann Selzer aside — have become increasingly reluctant to publish outliers. Herding may yield stronger performance for individual polling firms but reduces the benefit of averaging or aggregation since the polls are all basically telling you the same thing.

Still, on balance, the polls did really well by this metric, and we don’t want to take that away from them. Coupled with their strong performance in 2022, this at least does not suggest an industry in crisis. But it does mean that it’s more important than ever to account for the possibility of a systematic polling error. Because probabilistic election models do this, that’s one advantage they have over simple polling averages — in fact, Trump sweeping all seven closely contested swing states was the most likely outcome in our model5.

Where things look worse is statistical bias: the extent to which polls miss in the same direction and consistently underestimate Democrats or Republicans. Historically, the direction of bias has been unpredictable cycle-to-cycle. For example, you’d see polls underestimate Democrats one year (say, 2012) and Republicans the next (2014 and 2016), with no clear year-to-year pattern.

But the polls have underestimated Republicans across the past three presidential elections. In 2016, the polls had a 3-point average bias toward Democrats. In 2020, bias was D+4.7 points. And this year, it was a smaller but still substantial at D +2.9. And that bias was highly consistent across different types of races — with about 3 points of Democratic bias in presidential, Senate, and House polls, and 2 points of bias in gubernatorial polls. With less and less ticket-splitting in presidential years, that’s what you’d expect.

The polls underestimating Trump again is concerning, especially because of how much work pollsters put into avoiding this exact result. There’s certainly a lot of blue (Democratic bias) in recent years in that chart. It’s also not entirely clear what’s driving the problem. It could, for example, be a Trump-specific issue. Democratic polling bias was much lower in the 2022 midterms and polls had a slight Republican bias in 2018, when Trump was off the ballot. If Trump is the issue, the polls in 2026 and 2028 might be fine in terms of repeated Democratic bias. But the pollsters we’ve spoken with have mixed feelings about this.

Finally, we can look at how often polls “call” elections correctly — simply meaning that the candidate ahead in the poll actually won. Now, we’ve never thought of this as a great way to assess how accurate the polls are. For instance, if the Selzer poll had Trump ahead of Harris but by only 1 point in Iowa — Trump actually won by 13 — we’d argue that still counts as a bad result, whereas if Harris had prevailed by 1 point (within the poll’s margin of error) it would be a pretty good one. Still, this measure can be used as a sanity check.

Across all cycles since 1998, polls have predicted the correct winner 78 percent of the time. In 2024, call accuracy was only 70 percent — the lowest in our database. Most of this inaccuracy was driven by presidential general election polls, which called only 63 percent of races correctly — many national and swing state polls had Harris ahead —- their worst performance since 1998. House polls also weren’t great this cycle, with only a 66 percent call accuracy — well below average for that race type. (Many of these are generic ballot polls; Republicans won the popular vote for House while some polls showed Democrats leading.) In contrast, Senate polls had pretty average call accuracy this cycle, and gubernatorial and presidential primary polls did much better than average by this metric.

Now this difference isn’t an indicator that the 2024 presidential primary polls were amazing while general election presidential polls were horribly flawed. Instead, it’s a function of the races being polled in each case. The Republican primaries were (to understate things) not exactly competitive. On the other hand, polls for the general election were neck-and-neck right up to November 5th. Furthermore, polling firms are becoming more efficient at deploying their (scarce) resources: in a highly polarized political environment, they have a pretty good idea of which states are competitive. There’s not much appetite for wasting money on an Alabama or Vermont poll when you could poll Georgia instead, for instance.

Why does this matter? Because poll-based calls get a lot more accurate when the margins get wider.

Historically, polls showing leads of less than 3 points call only 56 percent of races correctly — not much better than a coin flip. Once the margin is between 3 and 6 points, they get up to almost 70 percent accuracy. A 6-to-10-point margin? 86 percent accuracy. And for completely noncompetitive races, call accuracy quickly approaches 100 percent.

In other words, the high call accuracy in 2024 primary polls is completely expected, given Trump’s commanding lead throughout the race. On the other hand, the very close and often-tied general election polls between Trump and Harris simply weren’t able to consistently call the race correctly. When the polls are that close, their main utility is to tell you that the race is uncertain and that things could break either way.

So while we’re forgiving to pollsters for their poor score by this metric, we just can’t emphasize this point enough to journalists and other polling consumers. Please don’t treat leads of less than 3 points as telling you very much at all. Polls simply aren’t precise enough — they never have been and they never will be. For all intents and purposes, such races should be treated as toss-ups.

And that’s about it for our aggregate review of polling performance in 2024. But we can also look at how individual pollsters performed this year. You shouldn't put too much stock in a pollster’s performance in a single cycle — our pollster ratings that account for all of their data back to 1998 are better for judging their overall quality — but 2024 shifted our overall ratings more than most cycles do.

This table shows simple average error, bias, and Advanced Plus-Minus — basically, how the pollster’s average error compares to other pollsters’ in the same election, with various other statistical adjustments that account for which races are harder and easier to poll — for pollsters who conducted at least five polls in the 2023-2024 cycle. Negative plus-minus scores are better here; they indicate that the pollster was more accurate than others once accounting for these factors.

This year, many of the usual suspects like The New York Times/Siena College and Selzer are missing from the top of our list. Instead, based on simple average error, the top performers of 2024 were OnMessage Inc. (1.2 points of error), AtlasIntel (1.5 points), and Patriot Polling (1.5 points). These firms consistently had Trump leading nationally and in all or most of the battleground states in the weeks leading up to Election Day. And these excellent performances have shifted our pollster ratings: AtlasIntel’s rating has gone from an A to an A+ — and it is now the highest-rated pollster in our database — while OnMessage moved from a B/C to an A.

Mitchell Research, Echelon Insights, TIPP Insights, and The Washington Post also performed well based on polling error, all with 2 points of error on average. All of these firms also score well on Advanced Plus-Minus, but Public Policy Polling and Saint Anselm College top the charts by that measure, although with small sample sizes.

In terms of bias, almost every pollster on this list overestimated Democrats to some extent in 2024. OnMessage Inc. and AtlasIntel had the lowest bias out of all pollsters who conducted at least 5 polls, only overestimating Democrats by 0.1 points on average — about as good as it gets. Blueprint Polling, Public Policy Polling, Harris Insights & Analytics, and J.L. Partners were the only pollsters on the list who overestimated Republican candidates on average.

By far the pollster with the largest average error in the 2023-2024 cycle was Selzer, at 12.8 points. Ann Selzer’s firm also had the largest bias — D+14.8 to be precise. Much of this was driven by Selzer’s outlier poll in Iowa that showed Kamala Harris winning the state, but the firm also considerably overestimated Democrats’ performance in House races.6

Selzer, as you may know, is being sued by Trump, an action we think is deplorable on free speech grounds, as well as in its failure to understand the difficulties of polling. Despite her travails in 2024 — and the fact that our pollster ratings weight recent years more heavily — the firm still has a B+ rating, indicating above-average performance over the long run. Selzer has often proven her doubters wrong, although now she’s moving on to other ventures. But we can’t sugarcoat the fact that this time, her polls were an outlier in the wrong direction.

Plenty of other pollsters like Siena College, SurveyUSA, and YouGov had more normal-looking but still large biases of about 5 points toward Democratic candidates. With Trump beating his polls again, firms like YouGov that had Democratic-leaning house effects performed worse, while those with R-leaning ones were better.

The takeaway from these individual performance ratings is that while it’s important to consider historical track records when evaluating polls, this can very much be overdone, and it’s a bad idea to treat one poll as an oracular gold standard. Pollsters that have been very accurate in previous elections can have bad cycles. And relatively newer firms can end up outperforming everyone else.",2289,1,1,0.436871996505024,0.436871996505024
post_05_politico_trump_turnout.txt,post,Politico,2025-06-26,"President Donald Trump benefited from high voter turnout in the 2024 presidential election more than former Vice President Kamala Harris did, a Pew Research Center survey published Thursday found.

Trump won a larger percentage of voters who cast ballots last November after skipping the 2020 election, and the poll found roughly equal support between Trump and Harris among eligible voters who stayed home in 2024.

That finding bucks a trend in the presidential electorate dating back decades. Historical analysis of presidential elections has indicated Democrats generally have been more popular among nonvoters. In 2020, nonvoters preferred former President Joe Biden over Trump by 11 points.

The survey suggests that “if all Americans eligible to vote in 2024 had cast ballots, the overall margin in the popular vote likely would not have been much different,” the authors wrote.

Trump won 52 percent of 2024 voters who either stayed home in 2020 or weren’t eligible to vote, compared to 45 percent for Harris. That marks an increase for Trump, who lost voters in 2020 who skipped the 2016 election by eight points.

The analysis from Pew — its “validated voters” survey, which matches survey respondents to commercially available voter files to make sure respondents who said they voted actually did vote — has been conducted for every federal election since 2016 and is considered a gold standard piece of election data.

Sixty-four percent of the electorate voted in the 2024 election, the second-highest figure since 1960, trailing only the 2020 election.

The Trump campaign aggressively targeted voters who had skipped previous elections, focusing specifically on young men. Trump won 55 percent of voters who skipped both the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms, compared to 41 percent who backed Harris. The survey found that 12 percent of the 2024 electorate was made up of voters who skipped the previous midterm and presidential election.

The survey found that 44 percent of nonvoters said they would have voted for Trump had they voted, while 40 percent said they would have supported Harris.

The finding complicates the initial picture of the electorate in the days after last November’s election, when Democrats scrambled to explain how traditionally blue areas of the country shifted towards Trump. Some Democrats argued that the progressive movement to withhold support for Harris over the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war suppressed turnout among traditionally Democratic voters.

The survey also found Trump’s coalition of voters in 2024 to be more racially diverse than the voters who backed him in the 2020 and 2016 elections. Trump won 48 percent support from Hispanic voters in 2024, roughly equal to the 51 percent support Harris received. Trump also won 15 percent of Black voters, a seven-point increase from 2020.

Among voters who immigrated to the U.S. and became naturalized citizens, Trump received 47 percent of the vote, splitting the group about evenly with Harris, who received 51 percent support.

The Pew Research Center surveyed 8,942 U.S. citizens ages 18 and older who are members of the Center’s American Trends Panel and verified their turnout using commercial voter files that collect public state turnout records. The survey ran Nov. 12-17, 2024, and has a sampling error of plus-or-minus 1.4 percentage points for the entire survey.

post_06_AP_Democrats_down.txt,post,AP News,2026-02-18,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic candidates have notched a series of wins in recent special elections — but a new AP-NORC poll finds views of the Democratic Party among rank-and-file Democrats have not bounced back since President Donald Trump’s victory in 2024.

Only about 7 in 10 Democrats have a positive view of the Democratic Party, according to new polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. While the overwhelming majority of Democrats still feel good about their party, they’re much less positive than they’ve been in the past.

The midterm elections are still many months away, and lackluster favorability doesn’t spell electoral doom. Other factors could benefit Democrats this year, including broadly negative views of Trump and other Republicans. Additionally, recent polling has found that independents tend to identify more with the party that’s out of power, which could boost Democrats this year too. Historically, the party not in the White House has picked up seats in Congress in midterm elections.

But the lack of enthusiasm could be a longer-term problem for the party. Democrats’ favorability of their party plummeted after the 2024 election, from 85% in September 2024 to 67% in October 2025. And despite overwhelming victories in November’s off-season elections and a string of wins since then, those views haven’t recovered. Other polling indicates that Democrats are deeply frustrated with their party.

At the same time, there’s some potential good news for Democrats in the new poll. Although Republicans are slightly more enthusiastic about their own party, Americans in general don’t think highly of either party. Health care is on many Americans’ minds this year, and it’s an issue where Democrats have a large advantage, according to the survey. Meanwhile, Republicans have lost some ground on two of Trump’s signature issues, the economy and immigration, although Americans don’t necessarily trust Democrats more on those issues as a result.

Other polling suggests that Democrats’ post-2024 slump is unusually large.

In Gallup’s measure of favorability, Democrats’ positive views of their own party declined about 12 percentage points in the last year. That marked the lowest measure in that question’s history, which dates back to 2001. Notably, Democrats did not see a similar decline after their first loss to Trump in 2016.

That diminished view of the Democratic Party in the AP-NORC polling is consistent regardless of Democrats’ age, race, ideology or educational background — suggesting that appealing to a specific group or two won’t fix the problem.

A separate survey from the Pew Research Center last fall found roughly two-thirds of Democrats in September said their own party made them “frustrated” compared to just 4 in 10 Republicans.

Among those frustrated Democrats, about 4 in 10 felt their party was not fighting hard enough against Trump while about 1 in 10 said there was a lack of good leadership or a cohesive agenda.

It’s not just Democrats — Americans aren’t thrilled with either party right now.

Roughly one-quarter of Americans have a negative view of both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, according to the AP-NORC data. That double-negativity is especially sharp among independents and Americans under 45.

About half of U.S. adults only view one party positively, and only about 1 in 10 feel good about both parties.

But Democrats’ loss of goodwill is more recent. Polling over the last 25 years from Gallup shows that Americans used to feel much more positively toward the Democrats. Around 2010, public sentiment turned against the Democrats. Since then, at least half of Americans have held unfavorable views of the party, according to Gallup.

Negative views of the Democrats now rival the most negative points in time for the Republicans.

With health care at the top of Americans’ priority lists as costs and premiums rise, Democrats have a possible advantage going into the midterm year.

About one-third of U.S. adults — 35% — trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared to 23% for the Republicans. That is broadly in line with the last time the question was asked in October 2025.

At the same time, Republicans have lost some ground on the issues that were key to Trump’s reelection — the economy and immigration. But Democrats haven’t managed to capitalize on it. Only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults, 31%, say Republicans are the party they trust to handle the economy, down slightly from 36% last year. But Democrats haven’t made any gains on this issue; rather, slightly more Americans now say they trust “neither” party to handle the economy.

Neither party has an edge on who is better equipped to manage the cost of living, which was first asked in the most recent poll.

Republicans are also down slightly on handling immigration. Only about one-third of U.S. adults trust them to better handle immigration, an apparent decrease from 39% in October. Democrats didn’t appear to benefit from that shift either.

post_07_guardian_no_autopsy.txt,post,Guardian,2025-12-18,"The Democratic National Committee won’t release a review of its election loss in 2024, saying it would be a “distraction” from helping the party win going forward.

The party has been working on a so-called autopsy of 2024 since Kamala Harris lost the presidential election to Donald Trump.

Ken Martin, the DNC chair who previously said he would publicly release a review of the 2024 election, said in a statement that the review was complete and that the committee was “already putting our learnings into motion”.

“We’re winning again – even in places that haven’t gone blue in decades,” Martin said. “In our conversations with stakeholders from across the Democratic ecosystem, we are aligned on what’s important, and that’s learning from the past and winning the future. Here’s our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”

As part of the review, the committee interviewed people across all 50 states about issues with both the presidential and down-ballot races in 2024 and any previous structural challenges, a DNC official said. The results include lessons about organizing, communications, fundraising and spending, though the report found Democrats outspent Republicans at all levels, the official said.

The party was already implementing plans to address some of the issues raised, and releasing a retrospective report would take time and focus away from winning going forward, the official said.

The contents of the report have been the subject of speculation for months. The New York Times reported in July that the results of the post-election review were “expected to avoid the questions of whether former President Joseph R Biden Jr should have run for re-election in the first place, whether he should have exited the race earlier than he did and whether former vice-president Kamala Harris was the right choice to replace him, according to the people briefed on the process so far.”

RootsAction, a progressive grassroots group, released its autopsy of the 2024 election earlier this month, concluding that Harris focused more on courting moderates than motivating the Democratic base of working-class, young and progressive voters.

Xochitl Hinojosa, a former communications director for the DNC, called the decision not to release the report publicly the “right call”.

“The DNC knows how to implement lessons learned without creating a poorly timed distraction,” Hinojosa said. “Democrats don’t need to engage in a handwringing exercise about last year’s elections when we’re winning this year’s elections, and are on the path to crushing Republicans in the midterms.”",420,0,0,0,0
post_08_abc_close_no_landslide.txt,post,abcNEWS,2024-11-26,"Was the 2024 presidential election close?

It certainly didn't feel that way on election night and in the days immediately after. It became clear that President-elect Donald Trump was on pace to win relatively early in the evening. Interactive maps of election results showed the entire country shifting right. By Thursday, Trump had won 51 percent of the votes that had been counted thus far, more than 3 percentage points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris. Headlines declared that Trump's victory was ""resounding"" and a ""rout."" His allies proclaimed it was a ""decisive win"" and claimed a mandate.

But ballots were still being counted. As we've gotten more data and had the time to put the 2024 election in perspective, the truth has become clear: Yes, the 2024 presidential election was close. With more ballots counted, Trump's national popular vote lead is down to 1.6 points, and Harris could have won if she had done just a couple of points better in just a few states. Any argument that the 2024 election was a ""landslide"" is misleading. It relies on a combination of recency bias and using the wrong measuring sticks.

Let's go through those measuring sticks one at a time. The most obvious one pointing to a Trump landslide is the margin in the Electoral College. After months of punditry about how the 2024 election could be one of the closest elections of all time, Trump ended up winning all seven major swing states, which came as a surprise to many Americans (although it shouldn't have been, since we and many other analysts cautioned that a sweep was a possible, even likely, outcome). Assuming there are no faithless electors, that will give Trump a healthy 312-226 electoral-vote margin when the Electoral College convenes on Dec. 17.

But because of its winner-take-all nature, the Electoral College isn't a good measure of closeness. Imagine an election where one candidate wins every state and district 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent. That candidate would romp to a 538-0 victory in the Electoral College, but that election was obviously still very close. The same principle was at play in the 2024 election: Trump won six of the seven major swing states (Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) by 3.2 points or less. And he won Wisconsin by just 0.9 points, Michigan by just 1.4 points and Pennsylvania by just 1.7 points.

That's important because if Harris had won those three states (plus all the states and districts she actually did win), she would have gotten exactly 270 Electoral College votes. From this way of thinking about the election, you can see that Pennsylvania was the decisive state in the 2024 campaign — what we at 538 call the ""tipping-point state.""

In other words, if Harris had done just 1.8 points better across the board — or even just in those three states (although that's not usually how elections work) — she would be the president-elect right now.

That's a pretty close election by any standard — but we can see just how close it is by putting that number into historical context. There have been 20 presidential elections since the end of World War II, and in only six of them was the tipping-point state decided by a smaller margin than Pennsylvania was decided by this year.

Granted, two of those elections were 2016 and 2020: In both of those years, the tipping-point state was Wisconsin and was decided by less than 1 point. In that sense, it's understandable that 2024 felt like a big win for Trump: It was relatively big for him. But it certainly wasn't big if you take the historical long view, or even the medium view: In the two presidential elections before Trump came on the scene, former President Barack Obama won Colorado (the tipping-point state in both 2008 and 2012) by much bigger margins than Trump won Pennsylvania by this year.

And in fact, the same is true if you look at the Electoral College margin, Trump's main claim to landslide status. His likely 86-electoral-vote margin over Harris is larger than the 77 electoral votes he won by in 2016 or the 74 electoral votes that President Joe Biden won by in 2020. But it's smaller than the 126 electoral votes that Obama won by in 2012 and the 192 electoral votes that Obama won by in 2008. And once again, it is only the 14th-biggest Electoral College victory since the end of World War II.

Another way to assess the closeness of an election is, of course, the national popular vote. While the popular vote doesn't affect who actually wins the election, it can be relevant in discussions of how big of a mandate the winner has to govern. By this measure as well, 2024 was a historically close election. Since the end of World War II, only three elections had popular-vote margins smaller than Trump's current 1.6-point lead: 1960, 1968 and 2000.

Trump has a couple of rebuttals to this. The first is that he is only the second Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote since 1988 (the other was then-President George W. Bush in 2004). In an era in which the American electorate is typically slightly Democratic-leaning, that is an impressive accomplishment — but it doesn't make the 2024 election a ""landslide"" in absolute terms.

The second is that his 1.6-point popular-vote win represents a 6.1-point shift toward Republicans from the 2020 election. That's certainly a notable shift in only four years; the country hasn't changed its mind so quickly since racing 9.7 points to the left between Bush's 2004 win and Obama's 2008 win. But most of that movement is because Biden set a relatively high bar for Democrats by winning the 2020 popular vote by 4.5 points; if Biden had won by just, say, 1 point instead, the shift toward Trump wouldn't stand out.

High expectations for Democrats in the popular vote, along with the widely circulated maps showing big swings toward Trump in virtually every county in the country, may have played a big role in setting those early narratives that Trump had notched an overwhelming win. Another was probably the media's repeated warnings before the election that it might take days to project a winner. While that very easily could have come to pass, we may have overemphasized the point. It was also always possible that a winner would be projected on election night, which is of course what happened.

After it took until the Saturday after Election Day for media outlets to project that Biden had won the 2020 election, the relatively early projection in 2024 (ABC News projected him as the winner at 5:31 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday) probably made Trump's win seem more decisive. But once again, that's recency bias at play. The 2024 election actually took longer to project than all but three presidential elections since 1976. Apart from the interminable 2000 (when the race came down to a recount in Florida that didn't end until Dec. 12) and 2020 elections, only 2004 kept us in more suspense.

All in all, the idea that Trump won an overwhelming victory in 2024 is less grounded in the data and more based on a sense of surprise relative to (perhaps miscalibrated) expectations.

The debate over the closeness of the 2024 election may seem academic — Trump won; who cares if it was a landslide or not? — but it could have a very real impact on the ambitiousness of Trump's second term. Boasting about the scope of his win, Trump claimed in his victory speech that ""America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate"" to govern — a narrative that caught on in the media and with many voters, too. In a mid-November poll from HarrisX/Harvard University, 71 percent of registered voters said that Trump had a mandate to govern, including 50 percent who said he had a ""strong mandate.""

Trump is just the latest in a long line of presidents-elect trying to convert electoral success into political capital to pass their agendas. There's just one problem: Political scientists who have studied the idea of presidential mandates generally agree that they're made up. It's basically impossible to ascertain what voters had in mind when they went to the ballot box and whether a candidate's win was an explicit endorsement for a specific policy or approach to governing.

And according to research by 538 contributor Julia Azari, a professor at Marquette University, there is no relationship between how often a president-elect claims a mandate and how big their victory was. In fact, Azari even found that presidents are more likely to claim mandates when they are in a politically weak position, as a sort of act of desperation to claim that their policies have public support.

But research has also found that, much like Tinker Bell, mandates can exist if enough people believe that they do. According to political scientists Lawrence Grossback, David Peterson and James Stimson, when there is a media consensus that an election carries a mandate, Congress responds by passing major legislation. Azari and Peterson have further found that politicians themselves, like Trump, can push Congress to action as well, simply by insisting that they have a mandate. And per Azari, when a president-elect insists that he has a mandate, it is often accompanied by major expansions of presidential power.

In other words, regardless of how close the 2024 election was in reality, Trump's claims to a mandate suggest that Republicans are planning to govern like they won in a landslide.",1599,13,14,8.130081300813009,8.755472170106316
post_09_brookings_why_win.txt,post,Brookings,2024-11-06,"Trump won a personal victory in the 2024 election, sweeping all the swing states, improving his vote share just about everywhere, and—unlike his 2016 victory—garnering an outright majority of the popular vote. In addition, he led the Republican Party to a larger-than-expected Senate majority and, although many House races remain to be called, an expanded House majority may result as well. These gains are more than incremental; indeed, they may signal a new era in American politics.

Political scientists and historians will spend years analyzing the causes and significance of this election. My focus is more immediate. Although the data are imperfect and incomplete, I will offer preliminary answers to two questions, which are really two sides of the same coin: Why did Donald Trump win the 2024 presidential election, and why did Kamala Harris lose?

Donald Trump’s theory of the case was broadly correct. He and his campaign managers believed that it was possible to build on Republicans’ growing strength among white working-class voters to create a multi-ethnic working-class coalition. He was right: If the exit polls turn out to be accurate, he made strides among Latinos and African Americans, especially men. He increased his share of the Black male vote from 12% to 20% and carried Hispanic men by nine points, 54% to 45%.

The Trump campaign also believed that they could improve their performance among young adults, and they did—from 35% in 2020 to 42% this year. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most of this gain reflected a shift toward Trump among young men. Trump spent lots of time on podcasts, such as Joe Rogan’s, whose principal audiences are this otherwise hard-to-reach group.

After the Republican primaries, the victorious Trump forces faced a choice: They could moderate their message to reach out to disappointed backers of Nikki Haley, who ran a traditional Reagan conservative campaign, or they could continue their all-out appeal to the Republican base while enjoying the grudging support of his defeated adversary. They chose the latter course and won the gamble that the party would unite around them. Donald Trump received 94% of the Republican vote and as a bonus, reduced the Democratic edge among Independents from nine points in 2020 to five points this year.

The Trump campaign’s tactical choices paid off. Three turned out to be critical. First: Convinced that Trump’s intense personal bond with his supporters would do most of the mobilizing work, the campaign decided not to invest heavily in traditional get-out-the-vote organizing and instead outsourced it to supporting organizations. Although the Harris campaign touted its advantage in the “ground game,” there is little evidence that it made much of a difference.

Second: The Trump campaign decided that Harris’ stance on transgender issues was the Willie Horton of 2024 and invested heavily in negative advertising that dominated the airwaves throughout the South.1 Anecdotal evidence suggests that this campaign helped weaken Harris’ effort to portray herself as a common-sense center-left candidate rather than an emissary from San Francisco.

Third: Donald Trump chose to modulate his stance on abortion by declaring early on that each state should decide this matter for itself and then doubling down by vowing to veto a national abortion ban. Many longtime foes of abortion were disappointed, and some were outraged. Nevertheless, Trump paid no price, winning 81% of the white evangelical vote—virtually unchanged from four years ago.

The Harris campaign was always running uphill. She served as vice president to a president whose approval rating plunged in the middle of his first year in office and never recovered. The public’s judgment of his performance on two core issues—inflation and immigration—was harshly negative, and Harris inherited this disapproval when Joe Biden abandoned his quest for a second term.

The fact that Biden waited so long to leave the race also worked against Harris. The president’s tardy decision deprived her of the opportunity to sharpen her arguments in a primary fight and shortened the time she had to introduce herself to the voters. She did the best she could in the circumstances by quickly unifying the party and building on Biden’s campaign apparatus rather than starting from scratch, but she never entirely overcame the difficulties stemming from Biden’s timetable.

Harris’ theory of the case was flawed. Looking at examples from the 2022 elections, she assumed that putting reproductive rights at the center of her agenda would mobilize an army of angry women and move them to the polls in record numbers. This did not happen. Women’s share of the total vote rose only marginally from its level in 2020, and Harris’ share of the women who voted did not increase from Biden’s 2020 levels. It is hard to judge how much this emphasis on abortion contributed to Harris’ poor showing among men—just 43%, down from Biden’s 48% in 2020—but it did nothing to convince them that a Harris administration would be sensitive to their concerns.

Her closing argument—that Donald Trump posed a clear and present danger to democracy—fared little better. This happened in part because many Republicans and Independents saw Harris and the Democrats as the real threats to democracy, and also because the charge offered no new information that would sway voters whose minds weren’t made up. Donald Trump may be the best-known candidate in modern American history, making it difficult to change anyone’s view of him.

Harris’ tactical choices made her problems worse. First, she spurned opportunities to create a clearer political profile. Although Biden’s unpopularity burdened her campaign, she refused to separate herself from him in any way that broke through to persuadable voters. Similarly, by refusing to explain why she had abandoned the progressive positions on crime, immigration, health care, and climate change, she blurred the public’s perception of her and opened the door to the Trump campaign’s charge that she was a closet radical. Thinking back to the successful campaign of Bill Clinton in 1992, some Democrats were hoping Harris would have a “Sister Souljah” moment in which she broke with some party orthodoxy in order to show her independence, but this did not happen.

Second, Harris’ decision to avoid media interviews during the first half of her campaign created the impression that she was dependent on scripted remarks and afraid to think on her feet. Answering tough questions can enhance a candidate’s reputation for competence and character, a potential upside to which Harris and her campaign seemed oblivious for much too long.

Democrats knew that the election would be close, but the scope of their defeat will likely trigger recriminations first and then an extended period of soul-searching. As was the case after Michael Dukakis’ defeat in 1988, the party will be forced to engage in a debate about the causes of its defeat, and what is sure to be a long and lively primary campaign will determine the path forward.

Meanwhile, President Trump will be challenged to honor the sweeping promises he made during his campaign. It remains to be seen whether he can impose massive tariffs without raising costs for average families and triggering another round of inflation. Also uncertain is whether he can quell conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East as quickly as he claims while reducing America’s global commitments. And it is possible that trying to deport millions of immigrants present in the U.S. could blow up in his face by creating civil strife and a backlash among Latino voters who have rallied to this cause. If he fails to meet the hopes that he has aroused, especially in the new supporters who provided his majority, he and his party may pay a price in 2026 and beyond.",1269,0,0,0,0

Additionally, the survey considers how Christian nationalism and authoritarianism are linked to presidential vote choice. In the wake of the election results, the survey also considers Americans’ confidence in our elections, views about our political parties, and attitudes about the state of democracy in a second Trump term.

Americans report backing Donald Trump narrowly over Kamala Harris; while Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly backed their party’s nominee, independents slightly favored Harris.

Half of American voters (50%) report that they voted for Donald Trump, with slightly fewer voters reporting that they voted for Kamala Harris (48%). Just 2% of Americans report voting for other candidates.
More than nine in ten Republicans (94%) report voting for Donald Trump and more than nine in ten Democrats (95%) report voting for Kamala Harris.
Slightly more than half of independent voters (53%) say they voted for Kamala Harris, compared with 44% who say they voted for Donald Trump. Four percent of independents report voting for other candidates.

Racial differences in voting are pronounced, with Donald Trump garnering more support from white voters, especially non-college graduates. Hispanic voters slightly favored Kamala Harris and strong majorities of Black voters report voting for Harris.

While white voters report voting for Trump at higher levels than Harris (55% vs. 43%) overall, white voters without a college degree (66%) were 22 percentage points more likely than white voters with a college degree (44%) to support Trump.
Black voters overwhelmingly report voting for Harris over Trump (81% vs. 17%), with some variation by education levels: Black college-educated voters report voting for Harris at higher rates than working-class Black voters (86% vs. 78%).
Hispanic voters were more divided between Harris (53%) and Trump (45%), though Harris received stronger support from Hispanic college graduates (58%), compared with working-class Hispanic Americans (50%).

Religious divides in presidential vote choice are stark, with white evangelical Protestants strongly backing Trump and Black Protestants, the religiously unaffiliated, and non-Christian voters overwhelmingly supporting Harris.

White evangelical Protestants continue to be the religious group with the strongest backing of Donald Trump, with 85% reporting that they voted for the President-elect. Majorities of both white Catholics (59%) and white mainline/non-evangelical Protestants (57%) also report voting for Trump.
Strong majorities of Black Protestant voters (83%), unaffiliated voters (72%), those from other non-Christian religions (67%), and Jewish voters (62%) report voting for Harris.
Hispanic Catholic voters are more likely to report voting for Harris over Trump (55% v. 43%). In contrast, Hispanic Protestants are more likely to report voting for Trump over Harris (64% v. 36%).

Among white evangelical Protestants and white Catholics, higher church attendance is correlated with higher support for Trump.   

While solid majorities of white evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly supported Trump across all levels of church attendance, weekly church attenders reported voting for Trump at significantly higher levels (88%) than those who seldom or never attend church (77%).
White Catholics who attend church weekly report voting for Trump at higher levels (64%) than those who attend monthly (58%) or seldom/never (56%).
The opposite pattern appears among white mainline/non-evangelical Protestants, however: those who attend weekly (52%) report voting for Trump at lower levels than those who attend church less often.

Republican voters express high levels of satisfaction and excitement with the outcome of the election, while Democrats express high levels of worry, disappointment, and anger. Independent voters display more mixed emotions about the election’s outcome.

More than half of Republican voters (55%) express satisfaction with the election results; an additional 36% reported being very excited that Trump won.
Around half of Democratic voters (51%) are worried about the election outcome, one in four Democratic voters (28%) are disappointed in the outcome, while one in ten (11%) are angry about the election outcome.
The emotional response from independents toward the election outcome mirrors the national average, with roughly equal percentages reporting that they are either satisfied (29%) or worried (30%) about the election results.

Views about Christian nationalism, authoritarianism, and QAnon conspiracy theories strongly divide Americans in their vote choice for president.

A strong majority of Americans who qualify as Christian nationalism Adherents and Sympathizers report voting for Trump (83%), while almost two-thirds of Christian nationalism Rejecters and Skeptics (64%) report voting for Harris.[1]
Voters who score very high or high on the Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale (RWAS) report strongly supporting Trump (82%), while those voters who score very low or low overwhelmingly supported Harris (79%).[2]
QAnon believers are far more likely to report voting for Trump (81%) while QAnon rejecters report voting for Harris (73%) at much higher numbers.[3]

While few voters believe that God ordained Trump to be the winner of the election, belief in Trump’s divine endorsement is highest among white evangelical Protestants, Hispanic Protestants, and Americans who qualify as Christian nationalism Adherents and Sympathizers.

Just one in four voters (25%) agree with the idea that “God ordained Donald Trump to be the winner of the 2024 presidential election.”
White evangelical Protestants (60%) are the religious voters most likely to agree that Trump was divinely ordained to win, followed by Hispanic Protestants (45%).
Few Hispanic Catholics (25%), white Catholics (21%), or white mainline/non-evangelical Protestant voters (20%) agree that God ordained Trump to win; Jewish (18%), Black Protestant (17%), other non-Christian (15%), and unaffiliated (7%) voters are notably less likely to agree.
Voters who qualify as Christian nationalism Adherents and Sympathizers (59%) are five times as likely as Christian nationalism Rejecters and Skeptics (11%) to agree that God ordained Trump to win.


Republican voters are far more likely than Democratic voters to report high levels of confidence that the 2024 presidential election was conducted fairly and accurately; at the same time, most Republican voters continue to believe the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.

A majority of American voters (55%) are very confident the 2024 election was conducted fairly and accurately, compared with three in ten voters who agree that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump (31%).
Confidence in the fairness and accuracy of the 2024 election is much higher among Republican voters (66%) compared with Democratic voters (44%).
At the same time, Republican voters continue to believe the election was stolen in 2020 (63%) — a view that Democrats almost unanimously reject (4%).
Independent voters are closer to the national average in expressing both confidence in this year’s election (54%) and agreement with the false 2020 “stolen election” narrative (26%).

Compared with 2016, partisan polarization has intensified, with partisans increasingly likely to view the opposing party as a serious threat. While independent voters remain relatively stable in their views of the Democratic Party since 2016, they show growing concern about the Republican Party as a threat.

Republican voters are more likely to see the Democratic Party as a serious threat to the country today than they did when Trump first ran for office (60% in 2016 vs. 69% in 2024); however, the perception among Democrats that the Republican Party poses a serious threat has increased at a much higher rate in that same time (50% in 2016 vs. 81% in 2024).
While roughly one-third of independent voters continue to say the Democratic Party poses a serious threat today compared with 2016, they show a significant increase in concern about the threat posed by the Republican Party, up from 26% in 2016 to 42% in 2024.
Both Democratic and Republican voters have shown a decline in seeing their own party as a threat since 2016, suggesting stronger alignment within each party.

Strong majorities of both Republicans and Democrats believe that internal threats pose bigger threats to our nation than outsiders.

Seven in ten American voters (70%) agree that “In America today, the biggest dangers we face are not from outsiders, but from those living among us who want to destroy our country.”
Strong majorities of Republican voters (73%), Democratic voters (69%), and independent voters (65%) share this sentiment.

Looking ahead, confidence that our democracy will remain strong in the next four years varies sharply across political, racial, and ideological lines.

While about four in ten American voters (42%) are very confident that democracy will remain strong over the next four years, partisan differences are stark: most Republican voters (79%) are very confident in democracy, compared with roughly one-third of independent voters (35%), and just 5% of Democrats.
White voters remain the most confident in the strength of our democracy (47%), compared with about one-third of multiracial (35%), Hispanic (35%), and AAPI (32%) voters. Black voters (16%) are the least optimistic about the strength of our democracy in the next four years.
Christian nationalism Adherents and Sympathizers are far more confident in democracy (69%) than Rejecters and Skeptics (29%).

Partisanship, race, and Christian nationalist views strongly shape Americans’ confidence that Donald Trump will peacefully leave office at the end of his term.

About four in ten American voters (42%) are very confident that Donald Trump will peacefully leave office at the end of this term.
Most Republican voters (79%) are very confident that Trump will peacefully leave office, compared with 37% of independent voters and just 5% of Democratic voters.
About half of white (47%) and multiracial (46%) voters are confident that Trump will peacefully leave office at the end of his term, compared with over one-third of Hispanic (38%) and AAPI (35%) voters and only 16% of Black voters.
Christian nationalism Adherents and Sympathizers (69%) are more than twice as likely as Christian nationalism Rejecters and Skeptics (30%) to express confidence that Trump will peacefully leave office.

Confidence in free political expression in the wake of a new presidential administration is highest among Republicans, white voters, and Christian nationalism Adherents and Sympathizers, while Democrats, Black voters, and Christian nationalism Rejecters and Skeptics show the most pessimism.

About four in ten American voters (42%) are very confident that Americans will be able to freely express their political opinions, even if they differ from the incoming presidential administration.
Most Republican voters (72%) are very confident that Americans will be able to freely express their political opinions, compared with 38% of independent voters and 10% of Democratic voters.
White voters (45%) are the most likely to express confidence in the ability to freely express political opinions, while Black voters (20%) are the least confident.
Christian nationalism Adherent and Sympathizer voters (61%) are about twice as likely as Christian nationalism Rejecter and Skeptic voters (32%) to express confidence in their ability to freely express their political opinions.

Republican, white, and Christian nationalism Adherent and Sympathizer voters are far less likely to believe that Trump will use the power of the government for retribution than Democratic, Black, and Christian nationalism Rejecter and Skeptic voters.

Roughly one-third of American voters (35%) say they are “not at all confident” that Donald Trump will use the power of the government to punish his enemies.
Republican voters (63%) are the most confident that Trump will not use government power to exact political revenge, compared with 34% of independent voters, and just 6% of Democratic voters.
Four in ten white voters (40%) are “not at all confident” that Trump will use the power of the government to punish his enemies, followed by multiracial (35%), Hispanic (30%), and AAPI (25%) voters. Black voters (14%) are the least confident that Trump will avoid using government power to punish his enemies.
About one-quarter (26%) of voters who qualify as Christian nationalism Rejecters and Skeptics “are not at all confident” that Trump will use the government to exact political revenge, compared with more than half (55%) of Christian nationalism Adherent and Sympathizer voters.


Republican voters and voters who score high on the authoritarianism scale are the most likely to agree that the U.S. military should put undocumented immigrants into internment camps until they can be deported.  

Just one in four voters (26%) agree that the U.S. military should put immigrants who are in the country illegally into internment camps until they can be deported.
Republican voters (46%) are more than twice as likely as independent voters (19%) and more than five times as likely as Democratic voters (8%) to agree with this policy.
American voters who hold highly authoritarian views are six times as likely to agree with placing undocumented immigrants into such camps until they can be deported than American voters who largely reject authoritarianism (48% v. 8%).

As the holidays approach, Democratic voters are significantly more likely than Republican and independent voters to say they will reduce time with family due to political differences.      

Just 12% of American voters say they will be spending less time with certain family members because of their political views this holiday season.
Democratic voters (23%) are nearly five times as likely as Republican voters (5%) to say they will be spending less time with certain family members because of their political views.

pre_01_abc_fewer_polls.txt,pre,abcNEWS,2024-10-28,"As Election Day approaches, many of you may find yourselves obsessively checking the polls, poring over every minute change in our forecasts and averages to try to glean any new insights you can about the state of the race. We get it — looking at the polls is kind of our thing here at 538. But all that obsession over tiny shifts can get pretty exhausting, so today we decided to leave the horse race behind (just for a moment!) and zoom out to look at the bigger picture of the polling landscape this year.

Each election cycle brings its own challenges for the polling industry, from the steady transition from live phone to online polling, to plunging response rates that make it harder than ever to get a representative sample. All of these challenges (combined with less-than-stellar performances in 2016 and 2020) can make it easy to view political polling as stuck in a downward spiral.

But our analysis shows that there are more reasons to be optimistic than pessimistic about the state of the polls in 2024. While we've seen a decline in the volume of polls, there are still plenty of encouraging signs that make us confident in the data we have.

Let's start with some of the bad news: We have fewer polls this year than in previous presidential cycles. While we've collected more Senate polling than in most prior elections, the number of presidential and House polls has dropped notably from past cycles.

We've also seen a decline in the number of unique pollsters who have released at least one poll. So far this year, we've collected 1,532 national, state and district-level polls from 209 pollsters conducted between early May and late October; 1,301 of those polls included a presidential question, while 683 of them asked about at least one congressional race. (For more information about how we analyzed this data, see the methodology statement at the end of this article. And if you want to dive in yourself, you can download all the data we used for this story.)

This isn't the first cycle we've seen declines in the number of polls and pollsters: The 2022 midterms saw the fewest polls in a midterm since at least 2010, and the polls we did have were the most partisan on record. On the surface, it looks like 2024 may be a repeat of two years ago. But a closer analysis reveals that there's much more to the story than the topline numbers — and a lot fewer reasons to panic.

One possible explanation for this drop in the total number of polls is that the most prolific pollsters of 2024* are actually a bit less prolific than those of the past. There are only 10 pollsters that have released more than 25 surveys this cycle, fewer than 2020 (13 pollsters) and 2016 (11 pollsters). Moreover, these 10 most prolific pollsters account for a much smaller percentage of the data than they have in the past. In fact, this decrease in polls from the 10 most prolific pollsters accounts for a significant share (if not all) of the difference between the total number of 2024 polls and previous cycles; if the 10 pollsters that published the most surveys are removed from the dataset in each cycle, 2024 has more polls than two of the previous three cycles, and is behind 2020 by just 17 polls.

This is probably good news: Having a small number of pollsters contributing a large share of the surveys likely doesn't help give a broad picture of the race. In 2016, for example, the 10 most prolific pollsters accounted for 58 percent of all polls released during that cycle, which could cause more careless aggregators to put too much weight on the same methodology.

In addition, the number of polls in a cycle may be less important than the quality of those polls. Despite the gloomy 2022 pre-election polling outlook, polls ended up performing exceptionally well that year. And this year, there are signs that the polls may be of higher quality than in past presidential cycles.

For example, things look a lot better when we consider the 538 pollster rating of each poll this year, which can provide useful context about how much we can trust the data from a particular pollster. Fewer polls come from unrated firms than in the past, and the average pollster rating of polls for which we have historical data is also higher.

Part of the story here is that 2024 has seen a drop in the number of new pollsters, defined as pollsters for whom we hadn’t seen horse-race polling in previous presidential cycles and for whom we had no pollster rating based on past work. In 2024, we have 57 firms in our database that meet that definition, compared to 65 or 66 in each of the previous three cycles.

And while it may feel to some observers that we’ve seen an influx of new pollsters flooding the averages with data, the new pollsters of 2024 are fairly similar to those of previous cycles: On average, they’ve published 4.9 surveys, a bit less than the 5.4 surveys such pollsters put out in 2020 and a bit more than the 4 surveys new pollsters published in 2016.

Another sign that the polls may be higher quality this year: The 2024 congressional polls are less partisan than in past cycles (more on the presidential polls in a bit). This year is on track to have the lowest share of partisan House polls since at least 2008, at 61 percent. A similar story is playing out in Senate races, where only 16 percent of polls released this cycle have come from partisan sources. As a result, around a quarter of all Senate and House polls have a partisan flag, the lowest mark in the last four presidential cycles.

On the Senate side, this decline represents a more than 50 percent drop from 2020, when 35 percent of polls came from partisan sources. Still, the 2024 Senate mark is closer to what we saw in 2012 and 2016, when 14 and 20 percent of Senate polls, respectively, were partisan.

And while having a majority of House polls hail from partisan groups might seem like a lot, that's an unavoidable reality with this kind of polling. After all, most of the organizations who are actually interested enough (and well-funded enough) to poll individual district-level races are usually campaigns or party-affiliated groups. While it's still a high number, 61 percent is much lower than, say, in 2016, when about three out of every four (!) House polls came from a partisan source.

A smaller share of partisan House and Senate polling means that their results are less likely to be skewed toward one party or the other. Of course, our models already account for potential partisan bias, but the less you have to adjust a poll, the less room there is for error to creep in. That's good news for the overall accuracy and reliability of congressional polling averages and forecasts, and particularly beneficial for downballot races where we have less data to work with.

Beyond partisanship, the kinds of organizations that are sponsoring and conducting polls matters, too. So far this cycle, 50 percent of polls have been sponsored or conducted by media groups or universities. That's in line with the 55 percent from 2020, but much higher than prior cycles; in 2016, only 38 percent of polls came from media or university sources, and in 2012, it was just 30 percent.

Media organizations and universities are usually more rigorous, transparent and nonpartisan than other kinds of pollsters and sponsors. Just take a look at our pollster ratings — eight of the top 10 ranked pollsters are news organizations or universities. The fact that these groups are making up a large share of the polling this year is a good sign.

When it comes to the presidential election, we also have some good news: There is a lot of swing-state polling this time around, despite some assertions otherwise.** While the total number of polls in swing states has remained relatively stable, even increasing a bit from some previous cycles, the fact that so few states appear to be competitive this year has meant that pollsters have been able to focus their resources, yielding far more polls in each swing state than past cycles.

In addition to having, on average, more polls per swing state, none of the competitive states have been overlooked, as we've sometimes seen in the past. The swing state with the fewest polls this cycle is Nevada, where 69 polls have been conducted. In 2020, on the other hand, two states rated as lean Democratic, Nevada and New Hampshire, both had fewer than 20 surveys conducted in the run-up to the final weeks of the campaign. And while 69 polls in Nevada may be the fewest this year, that's more than any competitive state got in 2012: the most-polled state in that cycle was Florida, which topped out at 66 surveys.

On the other hand, there are some troubling trends we first observed in 2022 that have continued this cycle. While the number of polls for House races has been steadily dropping for years, we're also seeing a drop in the number of competitive races*** that pollsters have been focusing on. Of the 43 competitive races in 2024, 74 percent have been surveyed more than once, lower than both 2016 and 2012 and continuing a dropoff we first saw in 2020, but also observed during the 2022 midterms. And the total number of polls in competitive districts is the lowest we've seen in the last four presidential cycles.

One possible reason for this drop in polls of competitive races is a significant drop in partisan polls of these seats. There have been only 81 partisan surveys in competitive House seats, compared with 129 in 2020, 111 in 2016 and 157 in 2012. So while this makes the 2024 polls the least partisan overall (just 64 percent of 2024 House polls in competitive seats have a partisan sponsor), it may mean that internal campaign polling is being withheld more often than in past cycles. This gives us less insight into how the campaigns are running their races, as well as less data on not just the horse race, but issues impacting each district.

And while congressional polling has been noticeably less partisan this cycle, the decline in partisan presidential polling has not been as steep. This cycle, 14 percent of presidential polling has come from a partisan source, a slight decline from 2020, but still noticeably higher than in 2016 or 2012.

And while Democrats released the majority of partisan presidential polls from 2012-2020, the reverse is true this year, with Republican sources releasing more partisan surveys — though the split is still relatively close. Rather than a huge influx of new Republican pollsters and sponsors, the change seems to be driven mostly by Democratic organizations publishing fewer surveys; 11 percent of 2020's presidential polls had a Democratic sponsor, compared with just 5 percent of presidential polls in 2024.

We don't currently expect this to have a huge impact on our forecast and averages, however. As mentioned above, we account for a poll's partisanship when incorporating it into our models. The overall share of partisan presidential polls remains quite low, and the gap between the share of partisan polls released by each party isn't significantly different than in 2020. Given all of this, we aren't all that worried about these surveys tipping the scales too much in either direction.

The bottom line is, everything's OK. Even though we have a bit fewer polls than some recent cycles, the ones we do have are probably a little higher quality than in the past. We're seeing more data from sources we already know (and have a sense, based on our pollster ratings, of how much to trust) and fewer individual pollsters dominating the aggregates. Also, the cycle isn't over: We have another week to add to this data, so when all is said and done, we may end up exceeding some previous cycles (we're only 108 polls away from matching 2020's output when both cycles had 15 days to go, and in the last week of the campaign, we'll see a lot of new data). So the next time you have the urge to panic about the state of polling in 2024, take a deep breath — things aren't as bad as they may seem.",2096,3,5,1.4312977099236641,2.385496183206107
pre_02_guardian_hedgehog_porcupine.txt,pre,Guardian,2024-03-09,"In past years, the first phase of the general election has involved at least one of the presidential nominees introducing themselves to the broader public and presenting their case for taking the country in a new direction. But that has been rendered unnecessary this year: former president Donald Trump and president Joe Biden are very familiar to the American electorate – and they are broadly unpopular.

“I think this is the worst election in my lifetime,” said George Argodale, a Nikki Haley supporter from Gainesville, Virginia. “It’s just terrible that we don’t have better candidates.”

“That’s a sad state of affairs for our country that those are the two best candidates that we can come up with,” agreed Peggy Hudson, a primary voter in Charleston, South Carolina.

Judith Smith, from Moncks Corner, South Carolina, said of Biden and Trump: “That’s like choosing between a hedgehog and a porcupine.”

As the primary season sputters to an expected ending, following Haley’s withdrawal from the Republican primary on Wednesday, voters’ frustration with their general election options is palpable.

According to FiveThirtyEight’s polling averages, Biden’s approval rating now stands at 38.1%, and Trump’s rating rests at a nominally stronger 42.6%, meaning both men are disliked by a majority of Americans.

Those low opinions have carried into voters’ views on the general election. A YouGov-University of Massachusetts Amherst poll conducted in January found that 45% of Americans believe a Biden-Trump rematch is bad for the country. Another 26% say the rematch is neither good nor bad, while just 29% view it as good for the nation.

It’s not all for the same reason; the many voters lamenting their general election options represent a diverse array of ideological perspectives, ranging from anti-Trump Republicans to progressives outraged over Biden’s response to the war in Gaza.

“On the whole, there’s a lot of ambivalence and disappointment about the prospects of a rematch,” said Jesse Rhodes, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “There’s a widespread perception among those individuals that the candidates are too old and that they tend to focus on issues that are issues of yesterday.”

Conversations on the campaign trail reflect those commonly held beliefs, as a number of primary voters across multiple states said that they wished they had another option for November. Among anti-Trump Republicans, many of whom voted for Haley in their primaries, the potential re-election of the former president represents a return to the chaos that defined his first term. Echoing concerns shared by most Democrats, they predict that Trump would undermine the foundation of the US government if elected.

Vincent DiMaro, an 80-year-old voter in Charleston who voted for Haley in the primary last month, cited Trump’s temperament and Biden’s age of 81 as significant liabilities for the nation’s future (Trump is 77).

“I want to see the country survive, and I don’t think it will under Trump,” he said. But, he added: “I don’t think Biden is a particularly good president right now. I can’t be president. I know what my limitations are, and I’m in better shape than Biden.”

Argodale voted early in the Virginia primary to cast a ballot for Haley, but he said he would have to support Biden in the general election if Trump won the Republican nomination.

“I am on the conservative side of things, and [Haley] is the only viable candidate in my opinion,” he said. “[Trump] is just a terrible human being and doesn’t deserve any votes.”

Although Democrats broadly agree with that assessment, some carry concerns about Biden, particularly regarding his age. Hudson acknowledged her politics lean to the left, as she previously worked for the late Democratic senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, but she cast a primary ballot for Haley in Charleston because she is “disgusted” by Trump. Hudson indicated she would support Biden in November, but she lamented the options available to voters in the general election.

“Not that Joe Biden has not done a good job. He has done some very good things for this country,” Hudson said. “But I do think it is time for a new generation of leaders.”

The war in Gaza has presented a significant electoral vulnerability for Biden, as the president has faced intense criticism from progressives within his own party over his response to Israel’s airstrike campaign that has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians.

Progressive leaders in multiple states have organized campaigns to urge supporters to vote “uncommitted” or “leave it blank” instead of casting a ballot for Biden as a means of protesting his handling of the war. In Michigan, uncommitted won 13% of the vote in last month’s primary, and uncommitted captured 19% of votes in the Minnesota Democratic primary on Tuesday.

Hassan Jama, an imam in Minneapolis, Minnesota, campaigned for Biden in 2020 but has joined the uncommitted campaign. When asked about his options for November, he suggested he may vote for a candidate other than Biden or Trump. Voters can cast ballots for the independent presidential candidate, Cornel West, or the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, both of whom have condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza as “genocide”, or they could leave the top of the ticket blank.

“We’re not voting for Trump, definitely no,” Jama said. “We have more than two choices.”

Ruth Schultz, a Minnesota primary voter who has organized with MN Families for Palestine, similarly ruled out voting for Trump, but she would not yet commit to supporting Biden in the general election.

“I know that I will never vote for Trump. That is a given,” Schultz said. “I want to see President Biden take a stronger stance for peace and how to get a ceasefire and to use all the tools at his disposal in order to do that. I am watching that as a voter in the general election.”

The uproar among many left-leaning voters has created an enthusiasm gap between the two political parties that could pose a problem for Biden. Although many people who backed Biden in 2020 express concern about his re-election, Trump’s most loyal supporters remain as fervent as ever. According to the YouGov-UMass poll, 45% of Republicans believe the Biden-Trump rematch is good for the country, but only 21% of Democrats say the same.

When speaking to Trump voters on the campaign trail, many are quick to praise him as the best president of their lifetimes, and they display no hesitation about supporting him again this fall.

“I’ve been supporting him since he ran [in 2016], came down the escalator [at Trump Tower], ever since that,” said Chris Pennington, a voter from Johns Island, South Carolina. “I think he’s the best one to take on all the problems that we have.”

Argodale does not support Trump, but he has seen firsthand how much devotion he can inspire. “In my social circle, there are Trumpers, so they’re diehard,” he said. “If he shot somebody on Fifth Avenue, they’d still vote for him.”

If Biden wants to win in November, he will have to work to narrow that enthusiasm gap or bring enough reluctant independents into his camp – or, most likely, do both.

The widespread disappointment among voters regarding the Biden-Trump rematch will have sweeping political consequences this fall, but their opinions on the election also offer startling revelations about Americans’ fears for the country’s future.

The YouGov-UMass survey included open-ended questions that asked respondents what they believed would happen if the opposing party won the White House. The answers were both dire and specific, Rhodes said, with respondents predicting the end of democracy and a sharp rise in political persecution if their party were to lose.

“The perception that victory by the other candidate would be dangerous and threatening has been rising pretty consistently for some time,” Rhodes said. “I think what’s distinctive in this election cycle is just how intense those feelings are and how personal they are.”

Biden and Trump have both spoken in severe terms about what would happen if their opponent were to win, and those arguments appear to be sinking in for many voters.

Nathan Richter, who voted for Biden in Arlington, Virginia, on Tuesday, was concise when asked about the possibility of Trump’s return to the White House. “Please, God, no,” he said. “I question our country’s ability to withstand another four years of Trump.”

John Schuster said he plans to vote for Biden in November, but he cast a primary ballot for Haley because of his overwhelming concern about a Trump victory.

“There’s no greater imperative in the world than stopping Donald Trump,” Schuster said. “It’ll be the end of democracy and the world order if he becomes president.”

Biden supporters tend to frame the stakes of the election in terms of democracy and political violence, Rhodes noted, while Trump supporters’ concerns are more often shaped around a perceived threat that Democrats pose to American values. Douglas Benton, a Trump supporter from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, warned that the US would become a “third-world country” if Biden were to win reelection.

“Our business is broken,” Benton said. “That’s how we became the most profitable country on the planet, is through capitalism and democracy and laws. Right now all three of those are gone.”

Past elections have proven just how motivating negative emotions can be in turning out voters, which is why Rhodes believes that participation will still be high in November despite the nominees’ unpopularity.

“It’s not an election that is going to inspire people on the basis of positive sentiments,” Rhodes said. “But it is an election that I strongly suspect is going to ultimately mobilize a lot of people because they believe that their vote is important for protecting themselves.”",1614,1,7,0.6195786864931846,4.337050805452292
pre_03_guardian_sleepwalking.txt,pre,Guardian,2024-03-06,"Barring an act from a God, who has seemingly forsaken the American electorate, Donald Trump and Joe Biden will, again, be the Republican and Democratic candidates for president. Tuesday’s results all but assure that, and they can’t really have been a surprise to anyone who has paid close attention to the campaign thus far.

In fairness, most Americans still haven’t tuned in, nor many Democrats, who have spent much of the last year hoping against hope that one or more verdicts against Trump in the courts might hand them the election ⁠– and perhaps even put Trump behind bars before November. That was always a risky bet, but now the supreme court has put the trial over his attempted coup in 2020 on hold, while the other cases against him have uncertain timelines.

Meanwhile, Biden’s team and Democratic officials have been telling the press that Biden’s replacement on the ticket isn’t any likelier. The race, they insist, is already on.

Who’s ahead? All but a handful of high-quality national polls taken since January say it’s Trump. A New York Times poll fairly representative of the rest that drew a significant amount of media attention over the weekend put Trump ahead by five points, 48-43%, among registered voters. That’s the largest lead Trump has held in a Times poll since he launched his first presidential campaign in 2015.

Meanwhile, Biden, more unpopular than ever, sits at an approval rating of 38%. Ten per cent of those who voted for him in 2020 now say they will vote for Trump. And the demographic picture the poll paints is dire ⁠– not only for Biden but perhaps for the Democratic party as a whole.

Biden led strongly with women in 2020 and is now evidently tied with Trump among them; Biden won an estimated 72% of minorities without college degrees last time around and now leads by a mere six points, 47-41%. And while making broad demographic pronouncements on the basis of one poll is unwise, these results are roughly in keeping with some other data.

In Michigan for instance, where much of the focus last week was on the uncommitted vote against Biden in that state’s primary, Biden has generally been polling under 70% with that state’s crucial Black electorate, which he won with over 90% of the vote, according to exit polls, in 2020. Deficits like that with previously strong Democratic constituencies go some way towards explaining why Biden, at present, seems to be losing in every swing state given current polling.

The Biden campaign’s response to these numbers has been simple: all of the polls are wrong. “Polling continues to be at odds with how Americans vote, and consistently overestimates Donald Trump while underestimating President Biden,” Biden’s communications director, Michael Tyler, said over the weekend in a statement. “Whether it’s in special elections or in the presidential primaries, actual voter behavior tells us a lot more than any poll does and it tells a very clear story: Joe Biden and Democrats continue to outperform while Donald Trump and the party he leads are weak, cash-strapped and deeply divided.”

As Tyler and his colleagues surely know, though, the point about “actual voter behavior” is wrong. Primary election results are not very indicative of how strong candidates will be in a general election; if they were, Trump, who didn’t even win a majority of the Republican primary vote in 2016, never would have been president. And there’s basically zero relationship between results in special elections like the one Democrats just won in New York ⁠– which involve small, unrepresentative electorates in small, unrepresentative places ⁠– and presidential election results.

As flawed as they might be, general election polls are our surest guide to how the general electorate is feeling about the general election. In fact, as the political scientist David Faris noted recently, the leader at this point of the year in Real Clear Politics’ average of polls has gone on to win the election in every race since 2004 other than 2004 itself, with only a few points worth of difference between the margin and the final result.

In 2004, the exception, Kerry and Bush were virtually tied in early March, around 44-44%, while Bush went on to win the popular vote by just over two points. And even that exception is reflective of a trend that can’t be of much comfort to Democrats ⁠– in every race since 2004 save 2008’s post-crash election, the Democratic candidate has performed slightly worse in November than polls at this point in the year have suggested.

All told, we have every reason to believe that the hole Biden is in is real, as unfair as it might seem to his supporters. As rosily as they might evaluate his record in office so far, it looks substantially more mixed now than it did six months ago. It’s true that the economy is roaring by all available macroeconomic metrics and that Democrats under Biden have managed to pass the most expansive domestic policy agenda of any president since at least Lyndon Johnson.

But it’s also true that voters have been stung by high prices and interest rates, as well as the expiration of pandemic relief programs. Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was brave and laudable ⁠– both morally and strategically overdue. But he was hammered for it in the press and now faces a progressive insurrection over the US’s support for Israel’s inhumane offensive in Gaza so severe that the campaign is reportedly reducing large in-person events to avoid protesters.

And on immigration, still at the front of mind for many voters, Biden has functionally conceded that Trump has been right about the state of the border; while immigrants are less prone to crime than the native-born population and substantially responsible for the economic boom we’re experiencing, Democrats are trying their best to outflank the right on border security and asylum, to little effect thus far, rather than countering the racist myths Trump has propagated directly and focusing on a positive immigration reform agenda.

Most voters haven’t plugged into these policy debates; Biden wears his greatest liability to them on his face. According to the New York Times’ poll, 73% of registered voters, including 61% of voters who backed Biden in 2020, say he’s too old to effectively serve as president.

And as much as Democrats might want to blame the media for that perception in the wake of the Robert Hur report, this is a problem many of them foresaw themselves during the last campaign. “If Biden is elected he’s going to be 82 years old in four years and he won’t be running for reelection,” one campaign adviser told Politico’s Ryan Lizza flatly in 2019; according to Lizza, four sources close to Biden at the time told him that it was “virtually inconceivable” that he would mount another campaign.

Yet here we are ⁠– sitting between a Super Tuesday that Biden swept and what could be the most consequential State of the Union address in some time, given the opportunity it presents for the president both to demonstrate his lucidity and to outline, at long last, an actual plan for his next term. Previews of the speech suggest it will feature now familiar language about protecting democracy and “making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share”, along with some proposals on the opioid epidemic and veteran care.

But Biden will have to do substantially better than that to get his campaign right side up. Plainly, he’s become a symbol of our political system’s decrepitude ⁠– a stand-in for all the old men in Washington who voters believe, rightfully, can’t or won’t do much to dramatically improve their lives. He’ll have to prove to voters that he’s capable of both dreaming and doing ⁠– to sell an ambitious vision of further material progress over the next four years, not woolly rhetoric about ending polarization and bringing serenity back to politics that will leave him looking dishonest and even more ineffectual when the tenor of political life remains the same, as it surely will.

Whether or not Democrats control Congress will naturally constrain whether Biden makes good on that policy agenda; but having a compelling agenda in the offing to begin with might lift the candidates he’ll depend upon in his next term to victory. All that aside, faith in Biden’s capacity to lead and accomplish will rest in some part on whether and when the situation in Gaza comes to a peaceable resolution ⁠– getting a handle on the situation and pressuring Netanyahu into ending the war would be a significant turning point in his presidency.

There and elsewhere, Biden needs to find a new course. Otherwise, the election may be over before he realizes it.",1461,1,1,0.6844626967830253,0.6844626967830253
pre_04_abc_pennsylvania.txt,pre,abcNEWS,2024-10-29,"The entire nation will vote on the next president of the United States this fall, but the election will likely come down to seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. With the outsized importance of these states, it's worth taking a closer look at the data we have in each of them — not just where the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump stands today, but also each candidate's path to victory and what issues could tip the election. Last but most definitely not least: the Keystone State, Pennsylvania, arguably the most important swing state in 2024.

Still, Biden’s edge was slim: He carried Pennsylvania by just over 1 percentage point, a raw margin of only about 80,000 votes in a state that cast almost 7 million for president in 2020. The state also remained somewhat more right-leaning than the nation. In 2016, Pennsylvania swung to the right of the country, as Trump narrowly carried it by just under 1 point even as Democrat Hillary Clinton led nationally by about 2 points. Then in 2020, Biden’s narrow win in Pennsylvania was more than 3 points to the right of his national popular vote margin of about 4.5 points.

Pennsylvania could very well be on its way to another result that puts it just a bit to the right of the nation. The latest polling averages show Trump running 0.2 points ahead of Harris in Pennsylvania, while Harris leads nationally by 1.4 points.* Nonetheless, Harris is performing better in Pennsylvania than Biden was earlier this year: The president was trailing Trump by more than 4 points when he left the race in late July. Understandably, the 538 presidential forecast views Pennsylvania as a toss-up, with Trump winning a hair more than 1 in 2 simulations.

Not coincidentally, Pennsylvania is the most-polled state in the 2024 election cycle: Since Harris became the nominee, there have been over 100 presidential polls in the Keystone State, while no other state has more than 85 so far. For one thing, its 19 electoral votes make it the largest of the seven core swing states. And because of its size and competitiveness, Pennsylvania is also the most likely ""tipping-point"" state in 538’s presidential election forecast. (If we rank all the states in order of margin from most Democratic to most Republican, or vice versa, the tipping point is the place that delivers the 270th electoral vote to the winner.) Pennsylvania earns that status in 23 in 100 forecast simulations, putting it ahead of the next-closest state of North Carolina (16 in 100).

As a geographically large and populous state with a mix of urban areas, suburbs, mid-sized cities and sizable rural regions, Pennsylvania is diverse in many ways. In terms of where the state’s votes come from, the counties in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh metropolitan areas constituted 53 percent of the statewide vote in 2020, including 63 percent of Biden’s overall vote, indicative of how key those areas will be for Harris. By comparison, Trump won about 43 percent of his statewide votes from those two metro areas, so mid-sized communities and rural areas are more critical to his base.

Demographically, Pennsylvania is like the other northern battlegrounds in that its overall population is whiter than the country’s as a whole: about 73 percent non-Hispanic white compared with 57 percent nationally. Within the white population is a large and notable chunk of the state’s electorate: white voters without a four-year college degree, who accounted for 45 percent of Pennsylvania’s voters in 2020, per the exit poll. Nationally, this GOP-leaning group has shifted farther to the right in the Trump years.

Conversely, Democrats have made gains nationally among white voters with at least a four-year college degree, and the same is true in Pennsylvania. For instance, Philadelphia’s four suburban collar counties are fairly white and have nearly 30 percent of the state’s population that is white with a college degree. Not coincidentally, the quartet has collectively trended more Democratic than anywhere else in the state in recent years, backing Obama by 10 points in 2012 and Biden by 19 points in 2020, even as the state as a whole moved to the right over that time span.

While we don’t have much data that breaks down voters simultaneously by race and education specifically in Pennsylvania, state-level polling broken down by education more broadly suggests that Trump and Harris are both running around on par with their party’s performance in 2020.** Overall, voters without a four-year degree look likely to back Trump at a similar — or even higher — rate than in 2020: On average, Trump leads Harris 55 percent to 41 percent among this group, compared with his 54 percent to 45 percent edge in the 2020 exit poll. Meanwhile, college-educated Pennsylvanians prefer Harris by about the same margin they did Biden in 2020, 56 percent to 41 percent.

The heavily Democratic city of Philadelphia forms a key part of the state’s electoral math. But while the city’s collar counties have moved left, the city proper actually has shifted somewhat to the right, as Democrats’ substantial edge declined by about 4 points in each of the last two presidential cycles, from 71 points in 2012, to 67 points in 2016 and 63 points in 2020.

Black voters are a big part of the equation here: Only about 1 in 10 of Pennsylvania’s voters identified as Black in 2020, but nearly half the state’s Black population lives in the state’s largest city. And while Democrats appear to have gained in the more well-educated and affluent parts of Philadelphia, predominantly Black precincts have experienced at least a small decline in Democratic support and, also importantly, turnout rates. This could be a big concern for Harris: An average of recent Pennsylvania polls found her ahead 79 percent to 17 percent among Black voters, but that would be well down from Biden’s advantage in 2020 of 92 percent to 7 percent — a potentially critical gain for Trump.

The situation may be similar when it comes to Hispanic voters, who only made up about 5 percent of the state’s electorate in 2020, but remain a fast-growing part of it. In 2020, Biden won close to 7 in 10 Hispanic voters statewide, yet the trend wasn’t necessarily great for him as precincts with larger populations of Latino voters in Philadelphia shifted to the right. And polls find that, on average, Harris only leads 54 percent to 41 percent among Hispanic voters, which would be a big downtick from Biden’s 2020 showing.

One curious poll finding in Pennsylvania has to do with the 45-to-64 year old age group. Nationally, this group appears to have swung slightly toward Trump relative to where it was in 2020, but that’s not the case in Pennsylvania. Instead, this mostly Gen X group of voters has moved to the left: In recent polls, it only preferred Trump by about 6 points, on average, compared with his 16-point advantage in 2020 (although note that the groups are slightly different given that four years have passed). This could be just noise, but it is a trend that’s popped up across a number of polls.

The top issues for Pennsylvanians in this election do not differ dramatically from other places. For instance, in Redfield & Wilton’s polling, the top three issues across all seven major swing states are the economy, abortion and immigration, in line with national surveys.

Still, there are some nuances to the Keystone State regarding its top issues that are worth noting. For one thing, abortion might be a slightly better issue for Democrats in Pennsylvania than in most other swing states. A poll from The Washington Post/George Mason University found that 74 percent of voters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, second only to Nevada’s 78 percent. At the same time, immigration could be particularly helpful for the GOP, as the same polling found that more voters in Pennsylvania than in any other swing state (65 percent) said that undocumented immigrants ""generally make the communities they live in worse.""

Additionally, a big local issue is fracking, which ties into both the economy and the environment. In Franklin & Marshall College’s October survey, Pennsylvanians seemed fairly split on the economic impact of fracking but were less likely to say that it was harmful to the environment. Overall, only 36 percent said fracking has helped the economy some or a great deal, while 42 percent said it had not helped much or not at all. Yet 58 percent said fracking hadn’t hurt the environment much or at all, compared with just 21 percent who said it had harmed things some or a great deal. And 51 percent felt fracking had done more to help the economy, while 33 percent said it had done more to hurt the environment.

In addition to the presidential race, Pennsylvania has a number of key downballot races that could end up making a big difference in the balance of power in the state. The biggest of these is a tight U.S. Senate contest between three-term Democratic incumbent Sen. Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick, a former George W. Bush administration official who also ran in the 2022 Senate race, but lost in his party’s primary to television personality Mehmet Oz. In the polls, Casey had been enjoying an advantage of around 5-to-8 points for most of the year, but the race has tightened in recent weeks, with Casey now holding a lead of just 3.2 percentage points, well within the historical average 5.4-point polling error for Senate races. The 538 Senate forecast rates the Pennsylvania race as the third closest Senate contest in the nation, after Ohio and Wisconsin.

And it’s not just the Senate seat in Pennsylvania that could impact the balance of power in Washington this year. Pennsylvania is home to three U.S. House races currently rated as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report: the 7th, 8th and 10th districts.

Located in the eastern part of the state, the 7th District was identified by Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics as a presidential bellwether in the last four elections — the district, under its current boundaries, would have voted for the eventual president in each of those contests. The seat is currently represented by three-term Democratic Rep. Susan Wild, who was first elected in the 2018 Democratic wave. Her challenger is state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, who has served in the Pennsylvania state legislature since 2012. We have only one nonpartisan poll of the race, from the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion/Morning Call, which showed Wild ahead by 6 points. Notably, however, she has also led in all the partisan polls of the race too, including internal polls conducted on behalf of MacKenzie.

The 8th District is located in the state’s northeast, an ancestrally Democratic area around Scranton that has drifted right in recent years. Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright is defending his seat from GOP challenger Rob Bresnahan, a local businessman who runs a construction company. Cartwright was first elected in 2012, and his district was redrawn in 2018 to include more of the urban core around Scranton. While we have no public polling of this race yet, the district’s slim partisan lean (Trump won it by just 2.9 percentage points in 2020) keeps this race in the toss-up camp.

Finally, Pennsylvania’s 10th district — which includes the state capital of Harrisburg, the city of York and surrounding suburbs — has been very close all cycle. Spring and summer polling in the race showed Republican Rep. Scott Perry, a former chair of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, in a single-digit race against Janelle Stelson, a former local news anchor. A more recent, nonpartisan poll from Susquehanna Polling and Research has shown Stelson with a significant lead of 9 points, though it’s the only poll of the race since August. All this has caused election observers to shift the race from leaning Republican to a pure toss-up.

And it’s not just federal races happening in the Keystone state this fall. The state executive posts of attorney general, treasurer and auditor general are all on the ballot. Two Republican incumbents, Treasurer Stacy Garrity and Auditor General Tim DeFoor, are defending seats they won in 2020; the pair are the only two Republicans that currently hold statewide elected office in the commonwealth. Meanwhile, the open-seat race for attorney general is between Democratic former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale and Republican York County District Attorney Dave Sunday. While we haven’t seen many polls of these statewide races, the polls we do have indicate close races that may slightly favor Democrats in all three offices. Meanwhile, Democrats are also fighting to defend a razor-thin majority in the Pennsylvania state House, which tipped into Democratic control by just one seat in the 2022 midterms, the first time the party has controlled the chamber in over a decade.",2171,39,41,17.964071856287426,18.885306310456013
pre_05_guardian_six_months.txt,pre,Guardian,2024-05-05,"""You know what I hate?” Donald Trump asked in Freeland, Michigan, on Wednesday night. “When these guys get on television, they say – pundits, you know, the great pundits that never did a thing in their whole lives – ‘You know, we have two very unpopular candidates. We have Biden or we have Trump. These are very unpopular.’”

Watched by a crowd of adoring fans in Make America Great Again (Maga) regalia, against the backdrop of a plane marked “Trump” in giant gold letters, the former US president protested a little too much: “I’m not unpopular!”

Opinion polls disagree, showing Trump with a low approval rating thanks to voter concerns over his stance on abortion, his four criminal cases and the threat he poses to constitutional democracy. Fortunately for the Republican presidential nominee, Biden has job performance troubles of his own centred on inflation, immigration and his handling of the war in Gaza.

Call it the resistible force against the movable object. Six months out from one of the most consequential elections in American history, only a fool would bet with confidence on the outcome of the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years.

Larry Jacobs, director of the center for the study of politics and governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “It’s almost impossible to imagine Biden winning when you start stacking up the case against him. The economy appears to be in decline with high inflation. You’ve got signs of the Democratic coalition fraying, including the extraordinary protests and arrests of youth on college campuses, the backlash among Arab Americans with regards to Gaza.

“You put that together and it’s like, how could Biden win? And then you turn to Trump and it’s, how could a candidate who’s openly running on defying the will of voters win? It’s just an incomprehensible set of choices.”

Typically, an election involves two new candidates or an incumbent versus a challenger, creating plenty of scope for fresh discoveries. But Biden, 81, and 77-year-old Trump are already the two oldest men ever to occupy the White House, the subjects of countless books, newspaper articles and TV documentaries. Most voters have already made up their minds about them, or think they have.

However, a static election is playing out in an unstable landscape: British prime minister Harold Macmillan’s aphorism “Events, dear boy, events” on steroids. There are the aftershocks of a global pandemic that killed more than a million Americans. The January 6 attack on the US Capitol and the supreme court decision to end the constitutional right to abortion still reverberate. The wars in Ukraine and Gaza have provided an acid test of Biden’s foreign policy expertise.

Frank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster, said: “There’s not going to be an October surprise; every week is an October surprise. We have to get used to the predictability of the unpredictability and so it’s very dangerous to prognosticate in this environment because things are changing so quickly.”

In the average of national polls, Trump leads Biden by about 1.5 percentage points, a decline for Biden of about six points from the day of the 2020 election, and Trump holds the edge in the swing states that will decide the all-important electoral college. Worryingly for the president, surveys indicate that a significant minority of Black, Latino and Asian American voters are slipping away from him.

Luntz said: “Strategically, Trump is being helped by the three groups that have moved towards him in the last three years: young African Americans in Georgia and North Carolina; Latino voters in Arizona and Nevada; union voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

“Biden is weaker, but Trump has the capability to sabotage his own campaign and he won’t even know that he’s doing it. That’s not something Joe Biden will do. That’s why it’s so dangerous to say that Trump has the advantage because, in a single day, he can ruin it for himself.”

Polls suggest the economy remains the No 1 issue for voters. The perennial question “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” could win the day. While the US escaped a widely predicted recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials such as bread, eggs and petrol are weighing on voters.

Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost industrial output but has received little credit from voters so far. Polls suggest that voters believe they were better off during Trump’s presidency even though data says otherwise.

Donna Brazile, a former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “The United States is the only leading western country to come out of Covid with an economy that is not going to recession, where jobs are being created and consumer confidence is slightly rising.

“But unfortunately because of the supply chain issues that are still apparent and many other factors, including greedflation, many voters are very tired of the rising costs of everyday staples, whether that’s buying lumber or buying food on the table. It’s unpredictable. You go to the grocery store now, you don’t know if you need $100 or $10.”

Lodged deep in the national psyche, inflation could prove costly for Biden. Pamela Pugh, president of the Michigan state board of education and a candidate for the US Congress, has detected signs of African American voters shifting to Trump. “I am a Democrat but I do definitely have concern with what I do hear on the ground – and there is disconnect,” the 53-year-old said during an interview in Saginaw.

“We cannot force people to feel what they don’t feel and to say what they don’t feel. They’re not carrying the daily Democratic talking points. They’re speaking what they’re actually feeling.

“Do I think that Trump would do any better for us? No. But are people looking for leadership that is going to not fight timidly, that is not going to fight scared but is going to listen to them and fight for them? That is what people are looking for.”

Biden’s handling of immigration has also been criticised by both Republicans and Democrats as crossings at the US-Mexico border hit record highs. Luntz added: “Joe Biden has failed badly at that and it’s so obvious and you can’t get away from it. We see people coming across the border. We hear about the crimes that are committed. It’s been a shit show and arguably Trump had success with immigration; Joe Biden has not.”

Biden has led the response of western governments to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv. He has provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian assistance, but has faced sharp criticism from some Democrats for not pushing harder for a ceasefire or matching his tougher rhetoric on Israel with action.

Intensifying student protests over the war in Gaza also could hurt his re-election bid as Republicans and rightwing media seek to portray the mostly peaceful demonstrations as violent and antisemitic, hoping to drive division among Democrats and promotes a sense of national chaos. Meanwhile, third-party candidates Robert Kennedy Jr, Cornel West and Jill Stein could shave off further crucial votes.

Trump, more radical and extreme than in 2016 or 2020, has cast his third consecutive bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies. He describes supporters jailed for the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol as “hostages” and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric, refusing to rule out possible violence around the 2024 election.

He faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election as well as unlawfully keeping classified national security documents and falsifying business records. His first trial began in New York last month, forcing him to shuttle between courtroom appearances and campaign rallies.

Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist, said: “He is far more extreme and dangerous than he was in 2020. His performance on the stump is significantly degraded and disturbing and he’s going to be on trial for many months, which is going to further erode his strongman image and his standing with the public.

“He doesn’t have any way to make positive news. Donald Trump’s central way that he’s making positive news is by staying out of jail. I don’t think that’s going to be very effective for the six months.”

In New York, Trump has railed against the judge, violated a gag order and called the criminal charges a Democratic conspiracy designed to keep him from winning, with some of his legal challenges reaching the supreme court. The justice department denies any political interference.

If elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except “on day one”, later calling that “a joke”. He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists.

He earned opprobrium from western leaders for saying the US would not defend Nato members that failed to spend enough on defence and that he would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before reversing course.

Trump has made immigration his top domestic campaign issue, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, create holding camps, utilise the national guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to migrants as “animals” and has not ruled out building detention camps on US soil.

At this week’s rally in Michigan, Karen Mantyla, 65, was wearing a T-shirt that said “I’m still a Trump girl – I make no apologies”. She insisted: “He’s not a dictator, he’s just doing what’s right. There’s people here that need help and they’re letting all these illegals in and giving them everything and our poor people are suffering. They’re being killed by terrorists coming through. It’s ridiculous.”

Trump claims credit for the supreme court ruling overturning Roe v Wade and said abortion should remain a state issue. While he has criticised some Republican-led state actions such as Florida’s six-week abortion ban and Arizona’s revived civil war-era ban, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women’s pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans.

Democrats are hammering Trump over the issue and warning of the threat of a national ban. But Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, warned: “Some Democrats are putting too many of their eggs in the abortion basket. It’s a lot more encouraging psychologically than focusing on weaknesses in areas like the economy and immigration, so I can understand why it’s happening, and I hope they turn out to be right but I’m not confident that it will.”

Trump has yet to announce a vice-presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated. Mike Pence, who ran alongside Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was targeted by Trump and his supporters amid the January 6 attack, refused to endorse him in November’s contest. But the former president’s base of support remains stubbornly loyal.

Bob Horny, 70, a retired builder, said: “He’s a leader. I look at all the things going on in the world that probably wouldn’t be happening right now if Trump was president – for example, Ukraine, Israel, $2 gas we have. Everything is unbelievable right now. People don’t like Trump’s personality but we’re not voting for the pope. We’re voting for a leader.”

Some Democrats remain optimistic, noting the party’s overperformance in the midterms and other recent elections, as well as Biden’s huge fundraising advantage. Rosenberg said: “It’s a close, competitive election, but I would much rather be us than them.

“Over time, as voters check in and start paying more attention, the basic contrast between Biden being a successful president leading the country through challenging times and a guy who’s a real threat to many of the things we all hold dear will work in our favour and we’ll win. But we have a lot of work to do and a long way to go in this election. A lot is going to happen and a lot is going to change.”",2042,11,13,5.386875612144956,6.366307541625857
pre_06_gallup_final_indicators.txt,pre,Gallup,2024-10-30,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Gallup metrics tracking the nation’s mood continue to show Americans feeling negatively in October about the economy, the direction of the country and President Joe Biden’s job performance -- indicators that work in Republicans’ favor this election. At the same time, Americans rate the Republican and Democratic parties similarly, while viewing Kamala Harris more favorably than Donald Trump.

These findings are from Gallup’s October polling on several key dimensions about the state of the nation and presidential campaign. Gallup previously reported on the electoral significance of several of these metrics as measured in September, and, given the relative stability of the results this month, that analysis still holds.

This article examines the latest results by party, showing strong differences between Republicans and Democrats in the expected directions. That leaves the views of political independents as potentially most important to the presidential election outcome on Nov. 5 as Americans cast their ballots.

With the economy ranking as the top issue Americans say they will consider when voting, it’s notable that public confidence in the economy still skews strongly negative.

As Gallup has seen since inflation began rising in 2021, more Americans continue to describe national economic conditions as “poor” (46%) than as “excellent” or “good” (25%). Likewise, a much larger proportion say the economy is “getting worse” (62%) rather than “getting better” (32%). The average of these net perceptions results in a -26 score on Gallup’s Economic Confidence Index for October. This is based on Gallup’s Oct. 1-12 poll and is more in line with elections the incumbent party lost (in 1992 and 2020) than won.

Republicans and Democrats hold opposing views about the economy -- with large majorities of Republicans rating it “poor” and perceiving it is getting worse, while the slight majority of Democrats call it excellent or good, and two-thirds think it is getting better.

Independents’ views of the economy fall closer to those of Republicans than Democrats, with the slight majority rating the economy poor and about two-thirds saying it is worsening. This results in a -34 Economic Confidence Index score for independents, slightly worse than the national average.

Twenty-six percent of Americans in Gallup’s final preelection poll, conducted Oct. 14-27, say they are satisfied with the direction of the country, whereas 72% are dissatisfied.

Satisfaction is up slightly from 22% earlier this month, mainly because it has increased among independents, rising seven points to 25%. Meanwhile, Republicans’ satisfaction is down slightly from the 9% recorded Oct. 1-12, while Democrats’ hasn’t changed.

To date, the incumbent party has not won a presidential election with satisfaction this low, including in 1992 (22%), 2008 (13%) and 2020 (28%). The lowest satisfaction rating in a year the incumbent party won was 33% in 2012.

President Joe Biden’s job approval rating stands at 41% in late October, consistent with his rating over the past three years, including the time since his withdrawal from the presidential race in July. His Oct. 14-27 rating is dampened by 77% of Democrats approving -- subpar for a president’s party -- along with 38% of independents and just 6% of Republicans.

By contrast, Harris’ October job approval rating (measured in the early October survey) is slightly higher, at 45%, reflecting 94% of Democrats, 41% of independents and 8% of Republicans rating her positively.

As Gallup has previously noted, it is difficult to know how significant a sub-50% job approval is for a sitting vice president running for president, because there are not enough recent examples of this. Whereas incumbent presidents seeking reelection with less than a 48% approval rating have all lost, it’s unclear whether vice-presidential nominees’ prospects are as tethered to their vice-presidential rating.

Gallup’s final preelection reading of how Americans view the presidential and vice-presidential candidates asks simply whether respondents have a favorable or unfavorable view of each.

Overall, 49% of Americans have a favorable view of Kamala Harris, slightly higher than the 44% viewing Trump favorably.

Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, earns a higher favorable rating than Trump’s vice-presidential pick, JD Vance -- 45% versus 39%, respectively. Walz alone among the four candidates has a significantly higher favorable than unfavorable rating, whereas both Trump and Vance are viewed more unfavorably than favorably.

Despite Democrats’ advantages in favorability nationally, they are close to parity with Republicans among political independents. In this critical swing group, Harris is viewed favorably by 44% and Trump by 42%, while Walz edges out Vance, 39% to 36%.

Harris’ higher favorable rating than Trump’s nationally with this measure is notable, given that the candidate with the higher favorable rating has typically won recent presidential elections. Trump defied this pattern in 2016 when trailing Hillary Clinton in favorability, 35% to 40%, but did so by winning in the Electoral College, while Clinton won the popular vote. Using a different measure of favorability earlier this month, Gallup found Trump and Harris nearly tied, with 50% of Americans giving Trump a positive rating from +1 to +5 and 48% doing the same for Harris.

Meanwhile, Americans have similar views of the two major political parties in the latest poll: 44% have a favorable view of the Republican Party, and 43% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party. This masks a significant edge for the Republican Party with independents, among whom 42% view the Republican Party favorably and 33% the Democratic Party. The Republican advantage is somewhat offset by fewer Republicans than Democrats viewing their respective parties favorably -- 87% for the Republicans versus 92% for the Democrats.

Americans’ broad pessimism about the country’s direction, combined with dour assessments of the nation’s economy and Biden’s job performance, create a difficult environment for Harris in seeking to keep Democrats in charge at the White House.

In spite of these handicaps, Harris and her running mate have emerged from three months of campaigning earning higher favorable ratings nationally than their opponents. On the other hand, she does not appear to enjoy the same advantage among political independents, who could prove to be the swing vote in this election.

Taken together, this mix of findings offers encouragement for both campaigns -- for Trump, that people may be looking for change, and for Harris, that she is the more appealing candidate. Both findings are consistent with themes seen in recent polling, including Trump leading Harris as better able to handle the economy, while Harris is seen as having higher moral character.

Meanwhile, the tie in favorability between the Republican and Democratic parties could portend a close race in the other national election -- votes for U.S. House candidates that will decide control of Congress.",1100,0,0,0,0
pre_07_american_one_vote.txt,pre,American Progress,2024-09-16,"There is a common belief that voting does not matter because one vote cannot really make a difference. After all, more than 158 million people voted in the 2020 presidential election. In the face of such astronomical numbers, it may not feel that a single vote matters; but the truth is it does. Center for American Progress analysis of election data for U.S. Senate elections from 1976 to January 5, 2021, U.S. House elections from 1976 to 2022, and state office-level returns in 2016 compiled by the MIT Election Lab reveals that while large margins decide many elections, key elections often come down to just a handful of votes:

From 1976 to January 5, 2021, more than 85 U.S. Senate elections were decided by less than 3 percent of all votes cast.

From 1976 to 2022, more than 410 U.S. House elections were decided by less than 3 percent of all votes cast.

In the year 2016 alone, more than 340 state office elections were decided by fewer than 500 votes; of those, more than 85 were determined by fewer than 100 votes.

Although the data analyzed for this report did not cover local elections, local elections often come down to exceptionally slim margins. For example, in November 2021, 18 local elections in Ohio—12 candidate races and six local measures—ended in a tie.

This report explores the real-life impact of some of these close elections. Even though millions of Americans vote in presidential elections, the winner can be elected by just a handful of voters—less than the attendance for a baseball game or concert. This report examines examples of the policy impacts that these few votes can have, including how 312 votes cast in one state helped more than 40 million Americans access affordable health care, how 321 votes cast in one state legislative race in Minnesota helped shape the state’s laws, and how party control of the Virginia House of Delegates came down to a tie in one legislative race—meaning just one more person showing up to vote could have decided party control. Finally, the report discusses the importance of local elections and why voting in these elections is extremely powerful.

In the United States, the president is not elected based on the total number of votes Americans cast, but rather an antiquated system known as the Electoral College, whereby each state is allocated Electoral College votes equal to its number of U.S. senators and representatives. There are a total of 538 Electoral College votes; for a candidate to be elected president, they must receive a majority—at least 270—of these votes. This system means that the winner of the presidential election is not always the candidate receiving the most votes. In fact, five times throughout history, the candidate who received fewer total votes was elected president.

This system also means that not all voters have the same power in presidential elections. The Electoral College inflates the importance of a handful of “battleground” or “swing” states—highly contested states with enough Electoral College votes to sway an election—while reducing the power of votes in other states. As a result, the past few presidential elections have been closer than many realize.

For example, more than 158 million people voted in the 2020 presidential election. In fact, of the 158 million votes cast in 2020, the election was ultimately decided by just 42,918 votes. To put that number in perspective, it is just slightly more than the average attendance of a Los Angeles Dodgers game in 2023. Although Joe Biden received over 7 million more votes than Donald Trump, he was actually elected president because he received 306 Electoral College votes—more than the 270 votes needed. After breaking down the states where Biden won Electoral College votes by the narrowest margins, it can be reasoned that he won the presidency by just 42,918 votes cast across three states, securing Georgia by 0.23 percent (11,779 votes), Arizona by 0.3 percent (10,457 votes), and Wisconsin by 0.63 percent (20,682 votes). As a percentage of the total votes cast for president across the country, Joe Biden won the Electoral College thanks to a key battleground state margin of just 0.03 percent of the 158 million total votes cast nationwide.

In 2016, Donald Trump became president because he secured more Electoral College votes—despite the fact that Hillary Clinton received almost 2.9 million more total votes than Trump. After breaking down the votes behind the Electoral College, one finds that Trump became president because of 77,744 votes cast across three states; that is just a few thousand more people than the attendance for Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour in Pittsburgh on June 17, 2023. Specifically, Trump won the Electoral College votes from Michigan by 0.23 percent (10,704 votes), Pennsylvania by 0.72 percent (44,292 votes), and Wisconsin by 0.77 percent (22,748 votes). Taken as a percentage of the total votes cast for president across the country, Trump won by just 0.06 percent of the 137 million votes cast.

Then, there is the most closely decided presidential election in recent memory: the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. While more than 100 million voters cast ballots, the election was so close that it came down to a margin of just 537 votes in Florida.20 Due to a confusing “butterfly ballot” design, a problematic card-punch system that led to unclearly marked votes, and the U.S. Supreme Court halting a recount, to this day, there remains a heated dispute about whether the 537-vote margin should be considered the accurate final vote total.21 Regardless of where one finds themselves in this debate, if just a few-hundred additional individuals had voted for Gore, the country would have had a different president and perhaps could have been spared the uncertainty that continues to loom over this election.22

Although voters in battleground states may find these to be compelling examples of why their votes matter in presidential elections, individuals who do not live in these states may feel the opposite—that their vote does not matter. Moreover, states considered to be “battleground” or “swing” states shift over time. For example, Missouri was considered a swing state throughout most of the 20th century.23 Even as recently as 2008, political parties spent millions of dollars in Missouri trying to win its Electoral College votes,24 with John McCain narrowly beating out Barack Obama by 4,000 votes.25 However, after that cycle, Missouri lost its swing state status and has not reclaimed it: Currently, Missouri is considered a safely red state, with Republican presidential candidates having won it by large margins over the past few elections cycles.26

Policymakers and advocates have suggested abolishing the Electoral College and determining the winner of the presidency based on which candidate gets the most votes nationwide.27 This would help ensure that a vote for the president carries the same weight regardless of the state a voter lives in.

In the meantime, Americans living in non-swing states should not lose heart. Voting for the president is still an essential method for Americans to voice their opinion about the candidates and the policies they represent. Additionally, many other offices are up for election at the same time as the presidential election. Not only are votes more potent in these state and local elections, but the outcomes of these elections also often have a much more direct impact on daily life than the presidency.

As noted above, from 1976 to January 5, 2021, more than 85 U.S. Senate elections were decided by less than 3 percent of all votes cast.28 In many of these races, just a handful of votes not only determined who was elected but also helped shape national policy for decades.

In Minnesota’s 2008 U.S. Senate race, Al Franken ran against Republican incumbent Norm Coleman. The hotly contested election was so close that it took a recount and months of litigation before a court ultimately determined that Franken had received 1,212,629 votes while Coleman had received 1,212,317, meaning Franken won the election by just 312 votes.29

The significance of that election is that Franken’s win gave Senate Democrats a 60-40 majority and a way to bypass the filibuster—a tool in the U.S. Senate that allows any senator to halt the legislative process simply by objecting to a proposed bill. If a bill does not have 60 votes to overcome that objection, it cannot move forward. As explained in a recent CAP report about the filibuster, this means a small group of senators unrepresentative of the country as a whole “can abuse the filibuster to prevent almost any legislation from being passed by Congress.”30 For instance, the 21 least populous states have enough senators to prevent the majority from getting 60 votes, yet these states make up “only 11 percent of the country’s population and only 7 percent of the country’s Black population.”31 Franken’s election gave Senate Democrats a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, allowing the Senate to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on December 24, 2009, by a vote of 60-39.32

The ACA helped the nation’s uninsured rate drop “from 17.8 percent in 2010 to an all-time low of 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 2023.”33 Provisions such as those to expand Medicaid eligibility and allow young adults to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26 opened new pathways to comprehensive coverage for millions of previously uninsured Americans. In particular, the law’s premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions made buying and using insurance more affordable for lower-income adults and families who buy insurance on their own by reducing their premiums and out-of-pocket costs.34

Not only has the ACA drastically reduced the uninsured rate across the country; it has also prevented insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, including an estimated 135 million people under the age of 65.35 In addition, the ACA prohibits gender rating—a practice by which individual market insurers charge women up to 1.5 times more than men for health insurance—and prevents insurers from creating coverage limits, which has been particularly beneficial for the millions of Americans with disabilities.36

In Kentucky’s 1984 U.S. Senate race, Republican Mitch McConnell defeated incumbent Democrat Walter Dee Huddleston by 5,269 votes—just 0.41 percent of the total votes cast in that election.37 That election was remarkable in a few ways. First, it was the only Democratic seat that flipped Republican during the 1984 U.S. Senate election cycle.38 Second, McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election in Kentucky since 1968.39

Most critically, this was Mitch McConnell’s very first election to the U.S. Senate.40 Fast forward 40 years: McConnell is still in the U.S. Senate, serving as his party’s leader since 2006, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in American history and a major source of power in policymaking.41 Although McConnell has played a significant role in U.S. politics over the past 40 years, he has been most influential in shaping the U.S. Supreme Court into a bastion of extreme right-wing ideology.42 When Justice Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016, McConnell used his power to subvert the traditional system of appointing justices to the Supreme Court. McConnell united Senate Republicans to block President Obama from appointing a justice and kept the seat open until Donald Trump was elected in 2016, thus allowing a right-wing justice to be seated.

The basis for this move was a fabricated principle that a Supreme Court justice should not be appointed during presidential election years,43 a principle that McConnell ignored just a few years later when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away eight weeks before the 2020 presidential election. This time, McConnell rushed to get another right-wing justice seated on the Supreme Court: Amy Coney Barrett, who was nominated and had one of the fastest confirmations in history.44

In just a few years, McConnell oversaw the appointment of three new Supreme Court justices, solidifying a radical 6-3 right-wing majority.45 That majority has been responsible for rulings that repealed Roe v. Wade, stripping Americans of reproductive rights;46 granted presidents sweeping criminal immunity;47 gutted the ability of public agencies and Congress to protect Americans;48 deemed affirmative action in college and university admissions to be unconstitutional;49 struck down commonsense state laws concerning gun ownership;50 rejected the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to address climate change;51 and more.52

Votes have impacts beyond the election in which they are cast. Just a handful of seats often decide party control of the U.S. Senate, for example. Indeed, as of July 2024, Republicans hold 49 Senate seats, while Democrats hold 47 and independents hold four; but since the four independent senators caucus with the Democrats, Democrats control the Senate by a slim margin.53 Over the past 45 years, there have been 23 different Congresses, six—or roughly one-quarter—of which saw party control in the U.S. Senate determined by two seats or less.54

Just a handful of votes can, therefore, shift the balance of power within governing bodies. For example, in Washington’s U.S. Senate election in 2000, Democrat Maria Cantwell defeated Republican Slade Gorton, an 18-year incumbent, by just 2,229 votes out of nearly 2.5 million votes cast—a margin of 0.09 percent.55 Cantwell’s race made Washington the third state at the time to be represented by women in both U.S. Senate seats56 and created a 50-50 tie in the Senate.57

Small numbers of votes can also shift national power dynamics because of how elections shape political party leadership. A few examples:

In 2004, Republican John Thune defeated Democrat Tom Daschle by 4,508 votes—a margin of 1.15 percent—in the South Dakota U.S. Senate race.58 At the time, Daschle was the Senate minority leader. This election marked the first time since 1952 that a Senate party leader lost reelection.59 Thune has remained in the Senate since this election and is currently the Senate minority whip.60
In 1998, in Nevada, Democrat Harry Reid was reelected to a third term in the U.S. Senate by only 428 votes, 0.10 percent of the total 435,790 votes cast in the election.61 Reid served as the Democratic whip in the Senate from 1999 to 2005 and as the Democratic leader in the Senate from 2005 to 2015.62
In Florida, out of 8.19 million votes cast in 2018, Republican Rick Scott defeated Democrat Bill Nelson by 10,033 votes, only 0.12 percent of the vote.63 Rick Scott’s victory meant that, for the first time since 1875, Republicans held both of Florida’s U.S. Senate seats.64 During this term, Scott served as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 2021 to 2023.65

From 1976 to 2022, more than 410 U.S. House elections were decided by less than 3 percent of all votes cast.76

A recent election in California demonstrates just how close elections can be, even in a state where there are 22,171,899 registered voters.77

In March 2024, California held its federal primary elections, with the top two candidates receiving the most votes moving on to the general election. In the election for California’s 16th Congressional District, Democrat Sam Liccardo received the most votes, securing a spot in the general election. However, after the initial vote tally, two other Democratic candidates—Evan Low and Joe Simitian—tied for second place with 30,249 votes each.78 After a recount, the results revealed that Low’s total should have been 12 votes higher and Joe Simitian’s should have been seven votes higher. Thus, Low secured the second spot on the general election ballot by just five votes.79

Of the roughly 444,279 registered voters in the district,80 182,188 voters cast a ballot in the primary for California’s 16th Congressional District,81 and out of all votes cast, the deciding factor between which candidate would move on to the general election was just five votes. As both Low and Simitian stated when asked about the tie: “Every vote counts.”82

Indiana’s 8th Congressional District was once known as the “Bloody Eighth” because of the propensity of voters to vote incumbents out of office. In the decade before 1984, the district picked five different representatives, toggling from a Republican to a Democrat to a different Democrat to another Republican to a Democrat.83 And the 1984 election for this seat was just as dramatic as the district’s nickname.

The margin of votes separating Democrat Frank McCloskey and Republican Richard McIntyre was so small that after an initial recanvass and recount, a task force in the U.S. House of Representatives conducted another recount. Just a handful of votes could have flipped the results, so Democrats and Republicans fought hard over the recount process, arguing which ballots to count and how. Ultimately, a three-member task force determined that the final vote count was McCloskey: 116,645, McIntyre: 116,641—a four-vote victory for McCloskey.84 In fact, the margin of victory was so close that it rounded to 0.00 percent of the total votes cast.

The 1984 Indiana 8th election was dubbed by Politico to be a “foundational moment in modern politics” given its far-reaching impact on the perception of post-election processes and partisan polarization generally.85 The contentious recount process led some to claim the election was “stolen”—a narrative used by many who disagree with election results today.

North Carolina’s 11th U.S. Congressional District provides several examples of close House elections. From 1982 to 1990, the seat changed political hands multiple times, and each election was determined by a margin of less than 3 percent:

In 1982, Democrat James Clarke defeated the incumbent Republican Bill Hendon by 1,325 votes, just 0.77 percent of the 171,047 votes cast.86
Two years later, in 1984, Clarke and Hendon faced off again, but this time, Hendon defeated Clarke by 4,314 votes, just 1.95 percent of the votes cast.87
The two men faced off a third time in 1986, with Clarke defeating Hendon by 2,506 votes, about 1.39 percent of the votes cast.88
In 1988, Clarke faced off against a new challenger, Republican Charles Taylor, and the two had similarly close elections:

In 1988, Clarke won reelection by just 1,529 votes, or 0.71 percent of votes cast.89
Undeterred, Taylor ran against Clarke again in 1990, but this time, Taylor won by 2,673 votes, or 1.33 percent of votes cast.90

In the year 2016 alone, more than 340 state office elections were decided by fewer than 500 votes; of those, more than 85 were determined by fewer than 100 votes.103

The legislative achievements of Minnesota’s 2023–2024 session exemplify the power of one vote. The state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party—an affiliate of the Democratic Party104—won a trifecta in state government for the first time since 2014. The DFL retained the governor’s mansion and the state House of Representatives and reclaimed control of the state Senate by a one-vote margin—34 to 33—in the 2022 midterm elections.105 This was made possible by the race in State Senate District 41, where DFL candidate Judy Seeberger defeated her Republican opponent by a razor-thin 321 votes.106 That is, 321 Minnesotans made the difference between unified DFL control and continued divided government in the state’s capital. With full control of the legislative process, DFL passed a multitude of progressive policies.107

Below is a sample of the laws that passed, all made possible by those 321 votes:

Abortion rights: On January 31, 2023, Gov. Tim Walz (D) signed into law the Protect Reproductive Options (PRO) Act, which makes reproductive freedom a fundamental right for every Minnesotan, protecting contraception, maternity care, abortion care, family planning and fertility services, and more.108
Climate action: Walz signed legislation into law on February 7, 2023, that requires utility companies to provide Minnesotans with 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040.109
Voting rights: In March 2023, Gov. Walz signed into law a bill that restored voting rights to more than 55,000 formerly incarcerated Minnesotans.110 Just a few months later, in May 2023, Walz signed the Democracy for the People Act into law.111 Among other provisions, this law institutes automatic voter registration, allows 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote, permits Minnesotans to sign up to be on a permanent absentee voter list so they can automatically receive an absentee ballot, and helps combat the influence of money in elections.112
Firearm regulations: On May 19, 2023, Gov. Walz signed firearm safety legislation into law. This legislation expanded background checks to include private gun transfers and implemented “red flag” laws to allow authorities to seek a court order to confiscate the firearms of individuals deemed high risk to themselves or others.113
Paid family and medical leave: On May 25, 2023, Gov. Walz signed the Paid Family and Medical Leave Act into law.114 This law provides Minnesota workers paid leave for events such as a serious medical condition or the need to care for a family member—including a newborn.115 The law provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave for each qualifying event, with a cap of 20 weeks per year.116

In 2017, there was an extremely close race between candidates in Virginia’s 94th District. The initial count showed Republican David Yancey had received 10 more votes than Democrat Shelly Simonds. However, a recount indicated that Simonds had received one more vote than Yancey.117 A three-judge panel was called to weigh in on an unclear ballot and ultimately determined that the candidates were tied at 11,608 votes each.118

Per state law, the winner of the tie would be determined by choosing a name randomly from a bowl.119 At stake was not only the seat but also control of the Virginia House of Delegates. If Democrat Simonds’ name was drawn, control of Virginia’s House would have been split between the two parties, ending 17 years of Republican control. If Republican Yancey’s name was drawn, Republicans would continue their control the Virginia House.120

Decisions as significant as which party controls a branch of state government should not be left to chance. On November 1, 2017, there were more than 47,000 active registered voters in Virginia’s 94th District.121 Yet only about 23,800 voters cast a ballot in the race.122 Any one of the more than 20,000 voters who did not cast a ballot could have decided the outcome of the race and control of the House. Instead, fate chose the outcome: Yancey’s name was drawn from the bowl.123

Voting can also serve an important role beyond determining which candidate is elected. Although Simonds lost the luck of the draw, she believes the votes cast for her were crucial in shaping policy. In 2018, Simonds stated that because she campaigned heavily on Medicaid expansion, and so many voters voted for her candidacy, the votes cast for her may have influenced Yancey’s policy stance on Medicaid expansion:

I think that it was one of the outcomes of our tied election. We really forced the issue of Medicaid expansion and really, I pressured him when I conceded to vote for it. And I know many of his constituents were also calling him. And in the end he did, and I think it’s because of the close election.124

Indeed, Yancey voted to support the Virginia budget, which included Medicaid expansion.125 As of August 15, 2024, more than 640,000 individuals were enrolled in Medicaid in Virginia because of the expansion, and more than 975,000 individuals have received services since Medicaid was expanded in the state.

Local governments are responsible for providing services critical to daily life.127 They oversee zoning decisions—which determine where you can live, work, and shop—along with housing services, parks, libraries, fire departments, law enforcement, emergency medical services, public transportation, road maintenance, trash collection, utilities, and more.128

Yet it is estimated that only 27 percent of eligible voters vote in the typical municipal election,129 and often, turnout is much lower.130 In fact, not only is turnout in local elections low, but those who do vote are generally not representative of the community. Older homeowners, for example, are dramatically overrepresented in local elections:131 A study of voter turnout in mayoral elections in the 30 largest U.S. cities found that residents 65 and older were 15 times more likely to cast a ballot than younger residents between 18 and 34.132 Another study that examined elections in more than 500 U.S. cities found that homeownership was associated with much higher levels of turnout; in particular, older homeowners are “dramatically overrepresented in local elections.”133 Additionally, racial turnout gaps persist at the local level, with white residents generally having higher turnout rates than voters of other racial groups.134 This means that an “extraordinarily unrepresentative set of residents” decides how the almost $2 trillion controlled by local governments is spent.135

The facts are similar for school board elections. The largest group of elected officials in the country are school board members,136 as roughly “90,000 school board members oversee the education of more than 50 million public school students.”137 School board members are not only integral to determining the quality of education students receive, but they also make decisions that can affect the general well-being of students and are responsible for allocating about $600 billion in expenditures.138

Despite this, voter turnout in school board elections is extremely low. The National School Boards Association estimates that voter turnout for local school board elections is generally only 5 to 10 percent.139 In fact, in 2023, no school board district election in Delaware had voter turnout of greater than 10 percent, and most school district elections recorded voter turnout well below 5 percent. A year earlier, in 2022, just four votes decided a Delaware school board race.140

While it is easy to get swept up in the fervor of presidential elections every four years, local elections also deserve attention. The fact that voter turnout in local elections is so low makes every vote matter even more. Critical decisions are being made daily at the local level; and those who vote in these elections are helping shape those decisions, often by just a handful of votes.

As mentioned earlier, in November 2021, 18 local elections in Ohio—12 candidate races and six local measures—ended in a tie.141 A coin flip or similar method determined the winner of these tied candidate races.142

One of those elections was for Fostoria City Council’s 4th Ward in Ohio. Councilman Thomas Lake defeated his challenger, Michael Spencer, on the literal flip of a coin after each candidate earned just 117 votes apiece. Importantly, city councils function as the legislative body for a particular municipality,143 approving city budgets, establishing criminal and civil laws, and regulating public health and safety.144

Given a city council’s centrality in shaping local life, both Fostoria City Council candidates expressed their frustration with voter apathy: “You would think there would be more than 234 people voting in a ward to decide what’s going on with elections, but that’s just how it is,” said Lake. “People don’t vote.”145 Spencer echoed Lake: “Everyone thinks their one vote doesn’t matter … you’re wrong! On local issues, especially … one vote would’ve made the difference.”146

In April 2024, Rock County, Wisconsin, held local elections in conjunction with its presidential primary election.147 The two candidates in this nonpartisan election for Rock County supervisor for District 11 campaigned on different priorities. Brandon Buchanan identified his top three priorities as: 1) removing nitrates, lead, and chemicals known as PFAS from water; 2) expanding mental health services, treatment courts, and alternatives to incarceration; and 3) investing in building more affordable housing.148 Lori Marshall, meanwhile, identified her top priorities as: 1) maintaining a balanced budget; 2) reigning in excess spending; and 3) limiting property tax increases.149 These issues are important and directly affect Rock County residents, yet the decision between the two sets of priorities was almost made by pulling a name from a red Solo cup.

After the initial count, the two candidates each received 190 votes.150 In Wisconsin, tied elections are decided by randomly choosing a winner. While the state’s election commission recommends using a coin flip or drawing a name from a hat, Rock County decided to use a red Solo cup as the “chalice of decision.”151 However, a recount was requested, and after reexamining the ballots, it was determined that the candidates were not tied; Marshall was the winner by just two votes.152 While a plastic cup ultimately was not the deciding factor this time, it was close.

An election should never come down to a red Solo cup playing a deciding role. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, 1,598 people were registered to vote in the wards that make up Rock County District 11.153 However, only 381 votes were cast in the election for Rock County District 11 supervisor.154

District 11 was not the only close election in Rock County’s local elections in April 2024 for county supervisor. Only two votes decided the Rock County District 13 supervisor race.155 In that election, 2,583 individuals were registered to vote in the wards that make up Rock County District 13,156 yet only 692 ballots were cast.157 Another seven county supervisor races during that election were decided by fewer than 100 votes.158

The elections highlighted in this report represent only a tiny fraction of the many times that just a handful of votes helped shape the future, through policy decisions and beyond. Elections help determine the course the country takes on the economy, domestic and foreign affairs, whether Americans have access to affordable health care, the role of law enforcement in communities across America, the quality of the air Americans breathe and the water they drink, how children are educated, and everything else in between.

Whether an election is decided by hundreds of thousands of votes or just a handful, in every case, the decisions are made by those who vote. A vote is more than just one ballot cast; each vote helps determine the future.",4918,11,29,2.236681577877186,5.896705978039853
pre_08_independent_independent_voters.txt,pre,Independent Center,NA,"At the Independent Center, we polled 1,000 registered voters to gauge their attitudes heading into the 2024 elections. Our survey explored how independent voters relate to the election, the key issues on their minds, and their voting intentions. Join the movement to access the full survey data.

When asked, “Do you approve or disapprove of the job the U.S. Congress is doing?” responses reflected widespread discontent:

63% of voters responded with either “somewhat disapprove” or “strongly disapprove.”
This data highlights voter frustration with Congress, suggesting anti-incumbent sentiment may play a significant role in the upcoming elections.

We asked voters to rank the issues most important to them. The top concerns were:

Economy (34%)
Immigration (16%)
Government (13%)
Health Care (12%)
Social Issues (10%)

The dominance of economic concerns suggests that financial stability and job security remain top priorities for independent voters.

When asked, “If the Presidential election were held today, how would you vote if your options were Republican Donald Trump, Democrat Joe Biden, and Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?” the responses were:

Trump: 42%
Biden: 39%
RFK Jr.: 13%
The 13% supporting RFK Jr. represents a significant bloc of independent voters who are dissatisfied with the two-party system.

When asked how they would vote for down-ballot candidates while supporting RFK Jr., voters responded:

19% would vote for more Republican candidates.
40% would vote for more Democratic candidates.
24% would vote for independent candidates.
17% were unsure.
This suggests RFK Jr.’s candidacy is drawing more support from Democrats than Republicans, but also indicates a notable independent voter bloc rejecting both major parties.

Independent voters are dissatisfied with the current state of governance and are actively seeking alternatives. The data reveals a growing appetite for non-traditional candidates who can challenge the status quo.

As the 2024 election nears, independent voters will play a crucial role in determining outcomes at every level. Candidates looking to appeal to this group must address their economic concerns and frustrations with the two-party system.",330,0,0,0,0
pre_09_brennan_undermine_election.txt,pre,Brennan Center,2024-08-05,"In 2020, 2022, and 2024, our nation held federal elections. Despite the pandemic, threats of violence, denial of results, and extraordinary pressure, these were secure and accurate. Election officials worked together across party lines. The system held.

This year, however, a new threat to free and fair elections has emerged: the federal government itself.

The Trump administration has launched a concerted drive to undermine American elections. These moves are unprecedented and in some cases illegal. They began with the pardon of the January 6 defendants who sought to overturn the 2020 results. They include affirmative attacks on democratic institutions, the repeal and withdrawal of voter protections, and symbolic or demonstrative moves. A clear pattern suggests a growing effort. As the 2026 midterms approach, that effort will likely gather momentum.

This resource offers the first chronicle of the Trump administration’s actions this year to undermine election integrity. They include:

attempting to rewrite election rules to burden voters and usurp control of election systems;
targeting or threatening to target election officials and others who keep elections free and fair;
supporting people who undermine election administration; and
retreating from the federal government’s role of protecting voters and the election process.
Why do we conclude this represents a concerted strategy? Among other things, President Trump tried to do this before. He was the first president to try to overturn the results of a presidential election and used federal power to do so. Institutions and key officials blocked him. These internal checks, however, are now gone, and many public officials will likely carry out the president’s will.

This campaign to undermine elections runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Only Congress and the states can set election rules. The executive branch, especially the Department of Justice (DOJ), is charged with enforcing federal laws. But neither the president nor the DOJ has the authority to set rules governing elections or to supervise the state and local officials who run them.

To be sure, previous elections were marred by rules and practices that hindered full participation. Restrictive voting laws (some of which had already been ruled unconstitutional), skewed maps, and bomb threats at polling places impeded the freedom to vote. Federal officials had an important role in countering disinformation and combatting racial discrimination. This federal protection for fair elections may no longer exist.

This unprecedented federal push will place new pressure on American elections and will require vigilance and actions from those determined to defend the integrity of the vote.

In March 2025, President Trump issued an executive order that aims to overhaul and exert partial control over significant parts of the nation’s election systems. The order includes several provisions; here we highlight three.

First, the order purports to direct the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) — an independent, bipartisan agency that assists states with election administration — to mandate that voters show a passport or other, similar document proving citizenship when they register to vote using the federal voter registration form.

Second, it attempts to force the EAC to amend its guidelines to rescind all previous certifications of voting equipment based on prior standards and, if appropriate, to re-certify voting systems under amended guidelines, which are to include provisions from the executive order. Eleven states and Washington, D.C., require their systems to be federally certified. And even states that do not require federal certification typically incorporate federal guidelines and testing and use voting systems that have been federally certified. Yet currently, just one voting system on the market complies with the standards issued prior to the executive order, and it was only certified on July 7, 2025. Replacing machines could cost states billions of dollars.

The president’s attempt to interfere with voting systems is not novel. In his first term, he tried to direct the attorney general, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to seize voting machines. He was unsuccessful. Yet now there are signs that the federal government may already be attempting to interfere with voting systems, beyond anything expressed in the executive order. A DHS official and an individual claiming to work for the administration have asked election officials in Colorado for access to their voting equipment.

Third, the order calls on the administration’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and DHS to obtain state voter files and other records kept by election officials, including voter list maintenance records. The DOJ has already requested voter lists from at least nine states, and at least two have provided them. Unredacted voter files and voter list maintenance records can contain sensitive private information about U.S. citizens. Other records may contain information that is subject to access controls for security reasons. Relatedly, the order mandates that states have access to federal citizenship data for voter list maintenance purposes; DHS recently overhauled and expanded the scope of its program for states to identify supposed noncitizens on the voter rolls.

Each of these provisions is analyzed in turn.

Impact: If implemented, the requirement to show a citizenship document to register to vote when using the federal form would undermine voting and disrupt election administration in multiple respects. The “show your papers” provision, which overlaps significantly with the policy laid out in the deeply unpopular SAVE Act (which has stalled in the U.S. Senate), could block millions of American citizens from voting. According to research by the Brennan Center, more than 21 million citizens do not have a birth certificate, a passport, or naturalization papers readily available.

Why It’s Wrong: A president has no right to rewrite the country’s election rules or regulate federal elections on his own. As a federal court recently put it, “The Constitution vests none of these powers in the President.” In issuing the order, the president claimed extraordinary unilateral authority to regulate federal elections and usurp the powers of Congress, the states, and the EAC, an independent, bipartisan federal agency.

Status: The order was challenged in five lawsuits across the country. Two courts have blocked some provisions while litigation proceeds, including those directing the EAC to add a requirement to show a passport or naturalization document to register to vote in federal elections. The same reasoning — that the president lacks authority to compel the EAC to act — would apply to other parts of the order that have not yet been carried out. Litigation is ongoing. 

Impact: The president’s directive in the executive order undermines faith in elections and voting machines and provides pretext for election deniers to discredit outcomes in the future. Any attempt to access voting machines by the administration makes this risk more pronounced. It may also encourage states to opt for hand-counting ballots, an error-prone process that can cause certification delays.

Why It’s Wrong: The president does not have the authority to regulate elections, including voting equipment guidelines. Nor does he have the power to direct the EAC, an independent agency, in any manner, as a federal court recently affirmed. And though certain federal agencies have authority to offer technical assistance or issue guidelines for voting equipment, none has authority to take exclusive custody of voting equipment for inspection. States also have rules on who can access equipment. In Colorado, for example, once someone other than an election official or other authorized person accesses a voting system, use of the equipment can be prohibited.

Status: Washington and Oregon have challenged the executive order’s provisions purporting to amend voting system guidelines. That litigation is ongoing. And though the EAC has drafted voting system guidelines pursuant to the order, the agency still must follow several steps under federal law before the guidelines can be implemented, including consulting with advisory boards of nonpartisan experts and posting the guidelines for public comment.

Impact: The administration could abuse voter file access to claim fraud and erode public trust in elections; it could also pressure state officials to target groups of voters and carry out unwarranted voter purges. Any disclosure of sensitive personal information puts individuals and groups at risk of being intimidated or doxed. And mishandling voter file data could expose U.S. elections to political and foreign interference.

Why It’s Wrong: DOGE has a track record of mishandling sensitive data. For example, within minutes after it gained access to the National Labor Relations Board’s systems in March 2025, someone with a Russian IP address made several attempts to access the database using one of the department’s newly created accounts. Those attempts were blocked, but the fact that foreign adversaries were able to immediately make such attempts indicates that election systems and the data they hold risk being compromised when left in the hands of DOGE. And for its part, DHS has previously failed to fulfill its privacy obligations.

Status: Depending on how DOGE or DHS uses or discloses data, it may run afoul of federal law, including the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. In some states, giving voter records to the federal government without written consent from voters would also be a violation of state law; in others, redaction would be required.

The Trump administration, falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, has already targeted organizations and individuals it sees as adverse with baseless or inappropriate retaliatory actions. It now threatens to do the same with certain election officials, civic groups that mobilize voters, and other individuals and entities that protect elections and the rule of law. These kinds of actions can be tools of retribution, intimidation, or coercion. 

A set of new federal task forces — the DOJ’s Weaponization Working Group, the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office Election Integrity Task Force, and the Washington, D.C., Attorney’s Office Special Unit: Election Accountability — establish a federal law enforcement approach to elections focused on targeting voters, election officials, perceived political adversaries, and journalists. The task forces devote resources to search for supposedly widespread voter fraud — a problem that doesn’t exist — and sanction political targeting.

Political appointees who have spread falsehoods about the outcome of the 2020 election, including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, and FBI Director Kash Patel, have empowered and enabled these task forces. Bondi, Dhillon, and Patel have also made clear they are willing to use the federal government to investigate and prosecute people they claim are responsible for supposed election fraud. Patel has stated, “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections — we’re going to come after you.” Bondi, in one of her first actions as attorney general, created the Weaponization Working Group, whose purpose is to “review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States over the last four years.” The administration has instructed the group to investigate some of the president’s perceived enemies, including former Special Counsel Jack Smith and his staff for investigating the January 6 riots, the Manhattan district attorney and the New York state attorney general for their involvement in the prosecution of Trump and his businesses, and anyone who investigated or prosecuted the January 6 rioters.

Impact: During President Trump’s first term in office, federal agencies and departments occasionally served as a restraint on his unlawful actions. For example, when the president asked the attorney general to seize voting machines after his 2020 election loss, then Attorney General Bill Barr refused. But in his second term, the president’s picks may not hold the line in the same way. Rather, they are poised to enable election interference by investigating perceived adversaries, targeting election officials, and casting doubt on election systems.

Why It’s Wrong: The DOJ can and should prosecute fraud in U.S. elections, but these task forces are premised on the false notions that U.S. elections are rigged and that there’s rampant voter fraud. Rather than ensuring election integrity, these task forces undermine it, part of the department’s serious shift away from protecting voting rights.

Status: The Constitution and the law serve as a limit on what these political appointees can do. Indeed, courts have already struck down this administration’s attempts to subvert the law. For example, multiple courts have found that the president’s executive orders targeting law firms violate the First Amendment, and two courts have preliminarily stopped the president from unlawfully trying to direct an independent, bipartisan agency to add a citizenship document requirement to the federal voter registration form. 

The president issued executive orders revoking the federal security clearances of six law firms and prohibiting the federal government from contracting with them. These firms had been involved in litigation protecting voting rights and are associated with people who challenged the January 6 attack on the Capitol, attempts to overturn the 2020 election, and election interference in 2016. The president specifically cited these associations as justification for targeting the firms. For example, the Paul Weiss order was based in part on the firm employing a lawyer who brought a lawsuit against an individual who had participated in the January 6 insurrection. The Perkins Coie order provided that the firm had represented a political opponent of the president, brought challenges to restrictive voter ID laws that made it harder for eligible citizens to vote, and, as the court enjoining the order stated, brought “election-related lawsuits . . . challenging actions supported by the president or his campaign.” Jenner & Block was targeted because it employed Andrew Weissman, who, as the court enjoining the order stated, “drew presidential disdain” for criticizing the president and participating “in a legitimate investigation of election interference” — that is, the investigation and prosecution of the president’s campaign team for crimes related to foreign interference in the 2016 election. The association with Weissman “extended that disdain to the firm,” the court added. And Covington & Burling, according to the executive order, “assisted former Special Counsel Jack Smith.” The firm had provided Smith with free legal advice when he was investigating the January 6 riots.

Impact: By targeting law firms for providing legal services — including free legal services — to causes the administration disapproves of, including protecting the freedom to vote, the orders have had a chilling effect on firms, including those that have not been directly targeted, diminishing the legal resources available to Americans whose voting rights have been violated. To some extent, the nonprofit sector and state attorneys general have stepped up to provide needed legal support, but gaps remain. This chilling effect extends beyond law firms. For instance, it may compel prosecutors to avoid pursuing charges against election interference. And the administration’s attempt to punish some of the most powerful and well-resourced legal institutions in the country sends a potent message to anyone considering taking a position the administration may oppose.

Why It’s Wrong: As multiple courts have found, these actions are illegal. The First Amendment prohibits government officials from retaliating against protected speech or association, including retaliating against law firms that represent or offer legal services to those engaged in protected speech or association whom the president happens to disfavor.

Status: Four of the targeted law firms challenged their respective executive orders, and judges have permanently blocked the orders for violating the First Amendment. Despite the clear illegality of the orders, nine firms have entered into agreements with the administration. As part of those agreements, these firms said they would provide free legal services for causes that the president approves of. 

The president and his DOJ appointees have repeatedly threatened to prosecute the election officials who administered the 2020 election. In a March 14, 2025, speech, President Trump stated, “What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.” The president has also threatened to target nonprofit advocacy groups that play an important role in voter engagement, election monitoring, and litigation to protect the freedom to vote.

These threats roughly track a proposal in Project 2025, the controversial conservative policy agenda created by the Heritage Foundation, to prosecute people who protected the 2020 election with federal crimes. Project 2025 proposed charging election officials with criminal conspiracy to injure civil rights for their alleged misapplication of state law to help voters cast ballots during the 2020 election.

The extent to which the administration will follow through on that plan is unclear, but it has already begun to target officials involved in protecting the 2020 election and build an infrastructure of task forces and working groups that heightens the threat of criminal prosecution. In one executive order, the president directed the DOJ to review the actions of Chris Krebs, whom the president appointed to lead the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 2018, because he “denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen.”

In addition to its Weaponization Working Group, the DOJ is reportedly exploring ways to criminally charge election officials for failing to maintain proper cybersecurity — based not on evidence but on assumptions driven by false claims of rampant voter fraud.

Impact: Criminal investigations and prosecutions would impose a severe personal and financial toll on election officials or nonprofit employees for simply doing their jobs to help keep elections free and fair. But beyond that, the harms that stem from targeting the officials and civil society groups that make our elections work are manifold.

Even if the administration never charges any officials, the threat alone of criminal investigation or prosecution will likely exacerbate the exodus of election officials from their jobs. In 2024 33 percent of local election officials knew at least one colleague who resigned at least in part due to fear for their safety, of increased threats, or of intimidation; 21 percent stated that they were unlikely to continue serving in their role for the 2026 midterms. In 2025 59 percent of officials reported fear of political interference in their ability to do their jobs. And 46 percent were very or somewhat concerned about potential politically motivated investigations of themselves or their peers. Ultimately the drain of experienced officials from U.S. elections will hurt voters.

The threat of criminal investigation may also prompt civil society organizations to retreat from their work to engage voters. When Florida recently passed a law threatening organizations conducting voter registration drives with civil and criminal penalties for violating a slew of new restrictive regulations, some organizations curtailed their work or stopped registering voters altogether.

The administration may also use the threat of criminal prosecution to pressure election officials to comply with unreasonable or unlawful requests. It may already be engaging in similar quid pro quo arrangements, as evidenced when the DOJ dropped corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the spring of 2025. Though the court ultimately ordered the case dismissed with prejudice (i.e., barring a future claim on the same facts), the DOJ had sought dismissal without prejudice, which would have left open the opportunity for the case to be refiled at a later time, and thus would have allowed the DOJ to hold the threat of prosecution over Adams should he not acquiesce to any requests the administration may make. The U.S. attorney responsible for the prosecution, who had been appointed by the president, resigned in protest, alleging that the decision was motivated by a desire to procure political cooperation from Adams on unrelated matters.

An election official fearful of criminal charges might succumb to pressure to aggressively purge voters from the rolls or to engage in outright election subversion. When the president tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election, he and his associates put pressure on state and local election officials — including, famously, in a phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — to assist his efforts. Raffensperger and other officials refused to subvert the results, but an election official facing the prospect of prosecution now might not take the same principled stand.

Why It’s Wrong: Threats of criminal charges based on lies about the 2020 election have no legal or factual basis. There is no evidence that the 2020 election was tainted by any kind of fraud or impropriety in election administration. Project 2025 proposes to use a law designed to protect civil rights, including the right to vote, to prosecute state officials for aiding in the exercise of that right, a legal theory that will likely struggle in court.

The First Amendment protects election officials and pro-voter groups from retaliation based on their speech and association, just as it protects the speech and association of law firms. If the administration targets officials or groups for publicly declaring elections to be legitimate, safe, and secure or for registering and engaging voters, the targets may be able to block any investigation or prosecution in court before it proceeds, just as those law firms have succeeded in blocking the executive orders leveled at them.

Moreover, federal and state law prohibits anyone, including federal officials, from intimidating voters and those, like election officials or civic engagement organizations, who assist or encourage them to vote. And though voters rarely do so, they are able to sue DOJ officials under anti-intimidation law in federal court.

Status: Thus far these threats have remained just that. For example, DOJ lawyers tasked with finding ways to prosecute election officials for allegedly failing to maintain proper cybersecurity are reportedly struggling to find any criminal statute that will allow them to do so. 

The federal government has rewarded people who peddle conspiracy theories about voter fraud and continue to deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election, including by resorting to violence. Many of this administration’s political appointees have continuously challenged the results of the 2020 election or otherwise undermined elections. At least four members of the president’s cabinet are election deniers.

The January 6 rioters violently attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to keep President Trump in office after he lost the 2020 presidential election. On the first day of his second term, the president pardoned approximately 1,500 individuals who had been on trial and commuted the sentences of 14 people who had been convicted for their participation in that attack.

Impact: The move green-lights future vigilante efforts to overturn elections, including efforts by the January 6 rioters themselves, by indicating that those who engage in political violence and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power may not only avoid legal consequences but also be treated as heroes. The president and others have cast the rioters as “warriors” and “political prisoners.” Republican Party events around the country have honored the rioters. Some of the insurrectionists have discussed or publicly stated plans to regroup following the pardons, and some have attempted or are considering runs for public office, including seats in Congress.

Why It’s Wrong: The pardons and commutations are a misuse of the president’s clemency power and an attempt to rewrite one of the most public crimes in U.S. history.

Status: The president cannot pardon people convicted of crimes under state law. While the events of January 6, 2021, took place in Washington, DC, under federal jurisdiction, similar acts anywhere else in the country would be governed by state laws, which prohibit violence, insurrection, and intimidation of voters and election officials.

Indeed, in part as a response to recent instances or threats of political violence, several states have strengthened such laws. For example, since 2020, 13 states have passed laws banning guns or expanding prohibitions against them in and around polling places or ballot drop boxes. In addition, local election officials have partnered with law enforcement to form the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections to protect voters and election workers from violence, threats, and intimidation. While the president is sending the message that his administration will reward those who undermine elections, states and local leaders are taking such threats seriously and have shored up the safety and security of elections.

In 2021 Tina Peters, a Colorado election clerk, gave a man unauthorized access to voting equipment; that man was affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a leading proponent of false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was rigged. She was convicted of four felonies under state law and sentenced to nine years in prison. The Trump administration is trying to get her out. In March 2025, the DOJ filed a statement of interest in support of her habeas corpus petition, a federal suit seeking her release from prison while she pursues an appeal. The filing states that the DOJ is evaluating whether the state prosecution, led by an elected Republican prosecutor, was politically motivated. On May 5, the federal court hearing Peters’s habeas petition held that a number of her claims were premature and suggested that it might dismiss her entire case. On the same day, the president took to social media to describe Peters as an “innocent Political Prisoner” and to direct the Justice Department to “take all necessary action to help secure” her release.

Impact: These actions could embolden rogue election officials to threaten elections from within. The president and the DOJ are sending a clear message that they will support such officials when they engage in subversive behavior. By announcing a review of a state prosecution, the DOJ is also indicating to state prosecutors that bringing charges against election officials who support Trump’s attempts at election subversion will subject them to scrutiny.

Why It’s Wrong: Neither the president nor the DOJ has the power to overturn a state conviction. Peters broke multiple state laws in support of a conspiracy theory. A jury found her guilty. President Trump undermines that finding by publicly declaring that Peters is innocent.

Status: Despite such threats, state officials continue to stand by their prosecution of Peters in court and in the media, and Peters continues to serve her sentence. 

The Trump administration is retreating from its responsibility to protect U.S. elections. State and local election officials no longer have a reliable partner in the federal government. And voters should not expect to have their voting rights vindicated by the DOJ. 

CISA is a component of the DHS responsible for helping to protect the cybersecurity and physical security of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including election systems. The agency provides voluntary, low-cost, and no-cost services, training, and assessments for state and local election officials across the country and helps these officials better understand the security threats their systems face.

The Trump administration severely undermined the structure and purpose of CISA in the president’s first few months in office. In February 2025, CISA put 17 of its election security staff on administrative leave. Additionally, DOGE fired 130 people from CISA; a judge later reinstated those employees to their positions, but they were immediately placed on administrative leave.

That same month, CISA paused all election security activities pending an internal review. The review was completed in March, but the Trump administration has refused to release the findings. It is unclear which CISA services have been restored, if any, despite repeated requests for information from members of Congress responsible for agency oversight. Reporting from April suggests that CISA is planning massive additional cuts.

In March 2025, CISA cut about $10 million in funding to the Center for Internet Security, a nonprofit with programs that benefit state and local election officials. As a result, funding was eliminated for the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a network that facilitates information sharing about security risks and best practices between election vendors and state and local election officials, and was reduced for the Multi-State Information and Analysis Center, a similar network that serves all state and local government entities.

Impact: Scaling back the expertise at CISA and cutting the critical funding it delivers to state and local officials for election security expose U.S. election infrastructure to cyberattacks and physical attacks, leaving election officials with less support to anticipate or recover from these attacks and to run safe and secure elections.

Why It’s Wrong: CISA’s dismantling occurs at a time when there are aggressive threats to our election system from foreign and domestic actors. Cyberattacks may also become more effective with the evolution of artificial intelligence.

Additionally, a federal judge found that the firing of CISA employees was illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act for failure to follow federal law and regulations. The employees were reinstated. Despite the ruling, however, CISA managed to accomplish the same outcome, a diminished workforce, by immediately placing those reinstated employees on administrative leave.

Status: In the absence of federal assistance, state and local officials can set up new interagency working groups on election security — initiatives that states have taken in past election cycles — as well as expand interstate information-sharing networks. States can also pass and enforce laws to protect election workers and infrastructure.

Shortly after being appointed to run the DOJ’s civil rights division, Assistant Attorney General Dhillon announced and implemented a “paradigm shift” that shirks the department’s responsibility to protect voting rights. While Dhillon describes the “usual approach” of previous Republican administrations as working to “slow the train down,” she envisions the division “turning the train around and driving in the opposite direction” under her leadership. Shortly after taking the helm, she also issued new mission statements that signal the division’s move away from protecting the rights of marginalized groups and toward efforts such as rooting out voter fraud, which is actually extremely rare. Project 2025 had proposed such a shift, also reflected in the president’s executive order on elections.

The DOJ has since dropped every voting case in which it had been a plaintiff at the start of this administration, and it has withdrawn its involvement in several other voting and redistricting suits. It also gutted the civil rights division of its career staff. By the end of May 2025, an estimated 250 attorneys making up approximately 70 percent of the division’s lawyers had left the department. The staff of the division’s voting section dwindled from approximately 30 lawyers down to about 6. But the division has begun hiring new attorneys. The voting section is now led by Maureen Riordan, a longtime DOJ lawyer who rejoined the department after a stint at the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), a conservative organization that has for years sued election officials to try to force aggressive purges of the voter rolls.

Under Riordan, the DOJ sued election administrators in North Carolina in an apparent attempt to prompt a purge of thousands of eligible voters from the rolls. The department also sued an Orange County, California, election official for failing to provide the department unredacted private information concerning voters he had removed from the rolls; the official had previously provided redacted records to ensure voter privacy, but the department did not agree with the redaction. The DOJ also filed statements of interest in Oregon and Illinois in support of another conservative activist organization’s lawsuits seeking more aggressive voter roll purges. And it issued letters to state election administrators in at least six other states —Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — identifying purported failures to satisfy federal laws governing voter list maintenance.

Impact: The Trump administration has signaled that it is unlikely to enforce laws to protect voting rights. That leaves voters particularly vulnerable in the seven states in the middle of the country that make up the Eighth Circuit, where the court of appeals recently ruled that only the DOJ can bring suits to enforce the Voting Rights Act’s central prohibition against discrimination against racial and language minorities. The ruling bars private plaintiffs such as voters and advocacy groups, who have historically brought the vast majority of these cases, from filing suit. Unless the Supreme Court overturns that ruling, voters in these seven states (Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) will essentially be left without the primary protections of the landmark civil rights law.

At the same time, the department’s new focus on litigation to press for more aggressive purges poses a threat to election administration and voters alike. Aggressive purges risk disenfranchising eligible voters, as evidenced by the department’s suit in North Carolina. As many as 200,000 North Carolina voter registration records are missing a driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number, a result of the state voter registration form’s poor design and likely mistakes in data management. These are errors by the state, not the voters themselves; moreover, the omission of these numbers from voter records indicates nothing about the eligibility of these people to vote. But the DOJ’s suit against North Carolina purportedly aimed at fixing the state’s mistakes asks for relief that would result in the removal of many of these voters from the rolls.

PILF and other groups have tried to force voter roll purges through lawsuits, and they have been unsuccessful in court time and again. That is because while federal law requires election officials to conduct “reasonable” voter list maintenance, it does not mandate a particular program for removing voters, nor does it require the removal of voters for mistakes in their records that are no fault of their own and indicate nothing about their eligibility.

Successful or not, these suits also feed a false narrative that U.S. elections are rife with fraud and provide fodder for attempts at overturning results. The DOJ’s suit in North Carolina follows a months-long attempt by a losing North Carolina Supreme Court candidate to reverse his defeat by using the same missing information in the state’s rolls to justify throwing out the validly cast votes of tens of thousands of eligible voters. The DOJ’s pursuit of cases like this one could lend legitimacy to similar election subversion efforts in the future.

Such suits also could provide cover for election officials to take bad-faith actions that would disenfranchise voters. Dozens of election officials around the country are themselves election deniers. They could use a suit by the DOJ as justification for purging thousands of voters from the rolls or applying a fringe legal interpretation to a federal law.

Why It’s Wrong: The DOJ has statutory duties to enforce federal laws that ensure greater access to the ballot box for all eligible Americans, including duties set out in the Civil Rights Acts, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Voting Accessibility for Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.

Status: The administration is still bound by the Constitution and the law. The abovementioned laws remain in full effect, and, despite the Eighth Circuit’s rogue ruling concerning the Voting Rights Act, many of them allow private enforcement through suits by voters and advocates. Private plaintiffs can and should bring legal challenges under federal law. Additionally, none of the new cases filed by the DOJ’s voting section have advanced to a decision in the courts, but organizations like the Brennan Center are seeking to intervene where appropriate to ensure that, when the courts do rule, voters’ interests are represented.

The Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances to ensure free and fair elections. The power to regulate elections lies in the hands of states and Congress. Courts and advocates complement this system to uphold the Constitution and federal law.

U.S. election infrastructure leaves no room for the president to insert himself. Yet that is exactly what he purports to do now: directing, dismantling, and weaponizing agencies so that the Trump administration can evade its responsibility to ensure the security of elections and the freedom to vote. Instead, the administration is setting the stage for election subversion. This power play poses a grave threat to the future of U.S. election infrastructure. It is also, in many respects, illegal. The various institutions and actors that operate the constitutional checks and balances safeguarding U.S. elections — including the courts, Congress, independent federal agencies, state legislatures, state and local election officials, and the people themselves — must prevent the Trump administration’s power grab from succeeding.

pre_10_gallup_economy_importance.txt,pre,Gallup,2024-10-09,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The economy ranks as the most important of 22 issues that U.S. registered voters say will influence their choice for president. It is the only issue on which a majority of voters, 52%, say the candidates’ positions on it are an “extremely important” influence on their vote. Another 38% of voters rate the economy as “very important,” which means the issue could be a significant factor to nine in 10 voters.

Voters view Donald Trump as better able than Kamala Harris to handle the economy, 54% versus 45%. Trump also has an edge on perceptions of his handling of immigration (+9 percentage points) and foreign affairs (+5), while Harris is seen as better on climate change (+26), abortion (+16) and healthcare (+10). The candidates are evenly matched on voters’ impressions of who would better address gun policy.

Just under half of voters overall agree with Trump (49%) or Harris (47%) on the issues that matter most to them.

These findings are from a Gallup poll conducted Sept. 16-28.

The current 52% of voters rating the economy as an “extremely important” influence on their vote for president is the highest since October 2008 during the Great Recession, when 55% of voters said the same. In polls conducted closest to the election in other presidential election years since 1996, between 38% and 44% of voters rated candidates’ positions on the economy as extremely important to their vote. Half of these readings are from September or October polling; the exceptions are 2000 (August), 2012 (February) and 2016 (May).

Besides the economy, no other issue receives an “extremely important” rating from most voters; however, majorities consider most issues as ""extremely"" or ""very important."" Just two issues -- climate change (50%) and transgender rights (38%) -- are viewed by less than a majority of voters as extremely or very important to their presidential vote choice.

Between 41% and 49% of voters say four issues are extremely important to their vote -- democracy in the U.S., terrorism and national security, the types of Supreme Court justices the candidates would pick if they became president, and immigration. Ten issues are rated as extremely important by 31% to 38% of voters, including education, healthcare, gun policy, abortion, taxes, crime, the distribution of income and wealth in the U.S., the federal budget deficit, foreign affairs, and the situation in the Middle East between the Israelis and Palestinians.

Fewer voters, 23% to 27%, consider five issues as extremely important to their vote choice -- energy policy, relations with Russia, race relations, relations with China and trade with other nations. Twenty-one percent of voters say climate change and 18% say transgender rights are of the utmost importance to their vote.

Whereas 66% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters rate the economy as extremely important to their presidential votes, far fewer Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters do (36%). The combined extremely/very important reading for the economy is 98% among Republican/Republican-leaning voters and 82% among Democratic/Democratic-leaning voters.

The economy is the top-ranked issue for Republican voters, but it is not among Democratic voters’ top five issues. In fact, there is no overlap between Republican and Democratic voters in the top five issues ranked as extremely important to their votes. For Democrats, democracy in the U.S., the types of Supreme Court justices the candidates would pick, abortion, healthcare and education are the five most important voting issues. Immigration, terrorism and national security, crime, and taxes round out Republican voters’ five top issues.

The current partisan divide on rating the economy extremely important is in marked contrast to 2008, when it was the top-scoring issue for both parties.

Voters differ significantly by party on the importance of most issues measured. The greatest difference is for immigration (40 points). The next-largest divergences among partisan voters are 29- to 32-point differences for five issues -- crime, climate change, the economy, the federal budget deficit and terrorism/national security.

Republican and Democratic voters rate three issues as similarly important -- education, relations with Russia, and gun policy.

Slim majorities of U.S. voters think Trump would do a better job than Harris when it comes to handling the economy (54%), immigration (54%) and foreign affairs (52%). At the same time, majorities of voters favor Harris over Trump to handle climate change (61%), abortion (56%) and healthcare (54%). Voters are evenly divided on which candidate would better deal with gun policy.

As would be expected, Republican and Democratic voters broadly favor their own party’s candidate to handle each of the issues. Majorities of Democratic voters, ranging from 88% to 97%, think Harris would be better on all seven issues.

There is more variation among Republicans for Trump’s ability to handle issues, ranging from highs of 97% on immigration and the economy to lows of 69% on climate change and 78% on abortion. One-quarter of Republican voters think Harris would be better on climate change and 16% say the same about abortion. No more than 11% of Democratic voters think Trump would be better than Harris on any of the issues.

Voters are evenly divided over whether they agree (49%) or disagree (50%) with Trump on the issues that matter most to them. They express similar levels of agreement with Harris’ stances on the issues they value most, as 47% say they agree with her, while 52% disagree.

Voters in both parties overwhelmingly say they agree with their party’s candidate on the issues that matter most to them -- 95% of Republican voters agree with Trump, and 92% agree with Harris.

Harris fares better than Joe Biden did in June, when 37% of U.S. voters said they agreed with him on the issues that matter most to them. Trump’s readings are essentially unchanged since June.

Economic confidence in the U.S. has been persistently low this year, which is reflected in U.S. voters rating the economy as the most important issue impacting their choice for president. While the economy often ranks as one of the top voting issues in presidential elections, this year it may be more influential than in any election since 2008 during the Great Recession. Trump is favored over Harris to better handle the issue, giving him a significant advantage in the election, though this is partly influenced by Republicans being more likely than Democrats to rate the economy as an extremely important issue.

Partisans differ sharply in their views of the most important vote issues this year, with no common issues among each group’s top five.",1080,0,0,0,0
